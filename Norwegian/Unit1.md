# Introduction

### A heartfelt welcome to the Norwegian course!

Norwegian is a language with simpler grammar than many other European languages, but it is still a gendered language with three grammatical genders: masculine, feminine and neuter.

---

#### Grammatical Gender

| Masculine | Feminine                   | Neuter    |
|:--------- |:-------------------------- |:--------- |
| en mann   | ei kvinne **or** en kvinne | et barn   |
| *a man*   | *a woman*                  | *a child* |

**All feminine gendered nouns can be classified as masculine gender as well.** In theory, one could treat all feminine nouns as masculine ones, but most Norwegians still use the feminine form to some degree, especially for certain words.

The choice really is up to you! Both **en kvinne** and **ei kvinne** are grammatically correct, and the tendency to use the feminine gender depends on geography and dialect.

We have opted to teach it where it is most natural to use it, with words such as **jente** meaning *girl*, for example, but in the first couple of skills we'll let you focus on the masculine and neuter noun patterns.

#### Pronouns

Norwegian pronouns are very straightforward and correspond well to English ones:

| Norwegian | English        |
|:--------- |:-------------- |
| **jeg**   | I              |
| **du**    | you (singular) |
| **han**   | he             |
| **hun**   | she            |
| **det**   | it             |

When referring to a neutral subject, **det** is used to mean *it* or *that*. However, when referring to a masculine or feminine subject, it becomes **den** instead.

---

#### Verbs

Conjugation couldn't be simpler. All conjugated verbs have an -r stem in the present, and verbs don't change according to the subject! How easy is that?

| Singular                     |                | Plural      |          |
|:---------------------------- |:-------------- |:----------- |:-------- |
| **jeg er**                   | I am           | **vi er**   | we are   |
| **du er**                    | you are        | **dere er** | you are  |
| **han**, **hun**, **det er** | he, she, it is | **de er**   | they are |

---

#### Pronunciation

As a general rule, words are spelled as they're pronounced in Norwegian. One exception is words beginning with **hv**, such as **hvem**, meaning *who*. In this word, the **h** is silent.

In addition, there are several letters and letter combinations that are pronounced differently from English.

| Norwegian         | IPA, Notes                                                                                                                 |
|:----------------- |:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A                 | [ɑ], very open                                                                                                             |
| B                 | [b]                                                                                                                        |
| C                 | [s] or [k] depending on word, very rare, ex. *Canada*                                                                      |
| D                 | [d], silent in consonant clusters or at the end of certain words like *med* or *ved*                                       |
| E                 | [e] or [ɛ], [æ] in *her* and *der*, [i] in *de*                                                                            |

| I                 | [i] like the *e* in *email* or *ebook*, [ɪ] before two consonants, like the *i* in *hit* or *fit*                          |

| K                 | [k]                                                                                                                        |
| kj, ki, ky        | [ç], traditionally like the sharp *h* in *human*, but more and more people now use [ʃ], like the *sh* in *ship* or *shell* |
| L                 | [l]                                                                                                                        |
| M                 | [m]                                                                                                                        |
| N                 | [n]                                                                                                                        |
| O                 | [u] like the *oo* in *soon*, but longer, [ʊ] before two consonants or in some exception words like *tog*                   |
| P                 | [p]                                                                                                                        |
| Q                 | [k], very rare, ex. *Qatar*                                                                                                |

| R                 | [ɾ], tap, like the *tt* in North American *butter*; many in Western Norway use [ʁ], the so-called *French R*               |
| rs                | [ʃ], *r* + *s* combinations produce *sh* sound, even between words                                                         |
| S                 | [s]                                                                                                                        |
| skj, ski, sky, sl | [ʃ], like the *sh* in *ship* or *shell*                                                                                    |
| T                 | [t], silent after an e sometimes, ex. *det*                                                                                |
| U                 | [ʉ], like the *ew* in *new*, but more closed                                                                               |
| V                 | [v]                                                                                                                        |

| X                 | [ks], very rare, ex. *taxi*                                                                                                |
| Y                 | [y] or [ʏ], like the *e* in *email*, but more closed                                                                       |
| Z                 | [s], very rare, ex. *zen*                                                                                                  |

Norwegian also has three additional letters that English doesn't have!

| Norwegian | IPA, Notes                                 |
|:--------- |:------------------------------------------ |
| Æ         | [æ], like the *a* in *mad* or *sad*        |
| Ø         | [ø], like the *o* in *word*, but more open |

# Who? What? Where

### Who? What? Where?

Confused yet? We have just the word for you...

**Hva** is the word for *what*, and also happens to be just the right thing to exclaim when you feel like you've been hit in the head with one Norwegian grammar rule too many.

In this skill, you'll also come across another question word, but you'll have to go look for it yourself, because we're not sure exactly *where* it went.

------

#### Plural Pronouns

You're already familiar with the singular pronouns **jeg**, **du**, **han**, **hun** and **det**, and now we're adding the plural pronouns into the mix.

| Norwegian | English      |
|:--------- |:------------ |
| **vi**    | we           |
| **dere**  | you (plural) |
| **de**    | they         |

Notice how Norwegian has two different pronouns for "you": **du** is the singular and **dere** is the plural version. An easy way to keep them apart, is to remember that the word representing more people has more letters in it.

------

#### Question Words

When you're just starting out learning a new language, few things are more useful than to be able to ask the questions that allow you to find what you need or further your learning. You've already learned one, **hvem**, and in this skill you'll learn two more of the most common question words.

| Norwegian | English |
|:--------- |:------- |
| **hvem**  | who     |
| **hva**   | what    |
| **hvor**  | where   |

Isn't it neat how they all resemble their English counterparts? You've probably noticed by now that English and Norwegian have many things in common, both when it comes to grammar and vocabulary. This is because they're closely related Germanic languages.

However, we do need to differentiate ourselves somehow, and so we decided to add some extra letters to our alphabet - just to keep things interesting.

------

#### Knowing

The verb **å vite**, *to know*, is an irregular verb in Norwegian. Its present tense, which you will familiarize yourself with in this skill, is **vet**. See that vowel change from the infinitive to the present? Cheeky!

There are actually several verbs for knowing, and you'll get to know them all in due time, but this particular one deals with factual knowledge. Some examples of that is knowing what or where something is, or knowing something about something or someone.

> **Vet du hvor det er?**
> Do you know where it is?
> 
> **Vet du hvem hun er?**
> Do you know who she is?

------

#### Three New Vowels

Norwegian has three extra vowels, **Æ**, **Ø** and **Å**.

| Vowel | Similar To                                                                 | IPA        |
|:----- |:-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |:---------- |
| Æ     | the *a* in *add* or *apple*                                                | [æ]        |
| Ø     | no real equivalent, but not far from the vowel sounds in *bird* or *earth* | [ø] or [œ] |
| Å     | the *o* in *open* or *old*                                                 | [o] or [ɔ] |

### Definite Forms

The definite form, *the man*, *the woman*, et cetera, is formed by attaching the indefinite article onto the end of the noun. This ending is called a postfix or a suffix.

| Indefinite |           | Definite |             |
|:---------- |:--------- |:-------- |:----------- |
| en mann    | *a man*   | mannen   | *the man*   |
| et barn    | *a child* | barnet   | *the child* |

Although the *t* is pronounced as such in the phrase **et barn**, it turns silent in the definite form, **barnet**, which is pronounced more like *barneh*. This is the case with all neuter nouns in the singular definite form. Be sure to drop the *t* sound, otherwise you might sound rather Swedish.

For feminine-classified nouns, there is one irregularity in the definite form:

| Indefinite                 |           | Definite              |             |
|:-------------------------- |:--------- |:--------------------- |:----------- |
| ei kvinne **or** en kvinne | *a woman* | kvinna **or** kvinnen | *the woman* |
| ei jente **or** en jente   | *a girl*  | jenta **or** jenten   | *the girl*  |

Both **jenta** and **jenten** are appropriate translations for *the girl*. These same endings apply to all feminine nouns. Please consult the tips and notes section for the first lesson if you would like a review of the Norwegian grammatical genders.

### Present

The present tense is used to describe things that are happening or are true now:

> **Jeg leser nå.** I am reading now.

The present tense is also in general statements that are independent of time:

> **Jorda er rund.** The earth is round.

For things that repeat and that are still recurring:

> **Jeg sover hver natt.** I sleep every night.

The present tense can be used to talk about the future as well, especially when it is certain:

> **Jeg reiser i morgen.** I leave tomorrow.

As a rule of thumb, you can use the present tense where you would use either the present (*I leave tomorrow.*) or present progressive (*I am leaving tomorrow.*) tenses in English.

You do not have to worry about person or number when dealing with verbs in Norwegian, the verb stays the same. This is even simpler than English where you have to remember to add the *-s* in the third person singular in the present tense.

Forming the present is extremely easy, just add the suffix *-r* to the infinitive (the form you'll find in the dictionary).

The table below shows you how to do it:

| Infinitive | Present     | English Translation          |
|:---------- |:----------- |:---------------------------- |
| å spise    | spise**r**  | eat(s), am/are/is eating     |
| å drikke   | drikke**r** | drink(s), am/are/is drinking |
| å se       | se**r**     | see(s), am/are/is seeing     |

# Animals

## Animals

Many animal names in Norwegian share etymological ties with English ones, but the meaning has drifted over time in one direction or another. Below are some examples.

**Beware these false friends!**

| Norwegian | Translation | Related Word |
|:--------- |:----------- |:------------ |
| **hund**  | dog         | hound        |
| **fugl**  | bird        | fowl         |
| **elg**   | moose       | elk*         |
| **dyr**   | animal      | deer         |

*In British English, "elg" and "elk" are actual cognates. In American English, "elk" refers to a different animal.

The following words are true friends, meaning that the words are similar in both spelling and meaning.

| Norwegian   | English  |
|:----------- |:-------- |
| **katt**    | cat      |
| **bjørn**   | bear     |
| **krabbe**  | crab     |
| **elefant** | elephant |
| **ulv**     | wolf     |
| **mus**     | mouse    |

You know more Norwegian than you thought you did!

### Grammatical and Biological Gender

After being introduced to nouns such as **ei jente**, **en gutt**, and **et barn**, you'd be forgiven for thinking that there was a correlation between a word's grammatical gender and its biological gender, or sex.

However, this is not the case. Grammatical gender is a completely independent concept. While **en hund** is a *masculine* noun, that does not imply that the dog we're referring to is male, that's just the grammatical gender of the word itself.

# Phrases

### Common Phrases

We've compiled a list of common phrases in the Norwegian language, for your reference.

Many of them are idiomatic, meaning that they don't translate word for word to English. You'll have to learn the entire phrase.

One example is "**Ha det bra!**", which literally means "Have it good!", but idiomatically translates to "Goodbye!"

| Norwegian               | English            |
|:----------------------- |:------------------ |
| **Hvordan har du det?** | How are you?       |
| **Hvordan går det?**    | How is it going?   |
| **Bare bra, takk!**     | Just fine, thanks! |
| **Jeg har det bra.**    | I'm doing well.    |
| **Ha det bra!**         | Goodbye!           |
| **Vi ses!**             | See you later!     |

### Norwegian Characters

By now, you're probably getting used to seeing the Norwegian vowels **Æ**, **Ø** and **Å** around.

| Vowel | Similar To                                                                 | IPA        |
|:----- |:-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |:---------- |
| **Æ** | the *a* in *add* or *apple*                                                | [æ]        |
| **Ø** | no real equivalent, but not far from the vowel sounds in *bird* or *earth* | [ø] or [œ] |
| **Å** | the *o* in *open* or *old*                                                 | [o] or [ɔ] |

If you're doing your Duolingo lessons on the app, you may need to install a Norwegian or international keyboard to type these. However, before you do so, try holding down **A** or **O** and see if they appear as options.

If you're doing your lessons on the web, you can either install a Norwegian keyboard, or just click the special characters displayed below the input field when you type your response.

When you have no other option, you can use these replacement characters, but don't get into the habit of relying on them, as it will be a hard one to break.

| Character | Replacement |
|:--------- |:----------- |
| **Æ**     | AE          |
| **Ø**     | OE          |
| **Å**     | AA          |

# Food

## Cooking

In this skill, you'll learn the verb **lager**, which translates to *make*. There's no separate verb for cooking, instead, we use **lager mat**, literally *make food*.

> **Han lager mat**.
> He is cooking.

### Measure Words

Remember that in Norwegian, the word for *of*, **av**, is omitted where one would normally use it in English to join a measure word with another noun.

| Norwegian         | English            |
|:----------------- |:------------------ |
| **en kopp kaffe** | *a cup of coffee*  |
| **et glass vann** | *a glass of water* |

Neat, huh?

# Object Pronouns

### Object Pronouns

We were introduced to the Norwegian pronouns in the first skill. Let's have a look at them here:

| Singular                      |                | Plural   |              |
|:----------------------------- |:-------------- |:-------- |:------------ |
| **jeg**                       | I              | **vi**   | we           |
| **du**                        | you (singular) | **dere** | you (plural) |
| **han**, **hun**, **den/det** | he, she, it    | **de**   | they         |

As in English, the pronouns above only pertain to subjects. The pronouns at the receiving end of a verb, in other words the *object pronouns*, are as follows:

| Singular                        |                | Plural   |              |
|:------------------------------- |:-------------- |:-------- |:------------ |
| **meg**                         | me             | **oss**  | us           |
| **deg**                         | you (singular) | **dere** | you (plural) |
| **ham**, **henne**, **det/den** | him, her, it   | **dem**  | them         |

**Den** is used to mean *it* or *that* when referring back to a masculine or feminine subject.

**Det** is used to mean *it* or *that* when referring back to a neuter subject, and when introducing a brand new noun that has not yet been mentioned - regardless of the gender of that noun.

**Han** is an alternative form of **ham**, but in this course we will use "han" exclusively as a subject ("he"), and "ham" for the object form ("him").

| Vocabulary    | (Tree 4)       |
|:------------- |:-------------- |
| **viser**     | show           |
| **meg**       | me             |
| **deg**       | you (singular) |
| **ham**       | him            |
| **henne**     | her            |
| **den** (m/f) | it             |
| **det** (n)   | it             |
| **oss**       | us             |
| **dere**      | you (plural)   |
| **dem**       | them           |

# Definite Forms

### Definite Forms

The definite form ("the man", "the woman", et cetera) is formed by placing the indefinite article, "a/an", or in Norwegian, "en/et", at the end of the word instead of at the beginning. This is called a postfix or a suffix.

| Indefinite |           | Definite |             |
|:---------- |:--------- |:-------- |:----------- |
| en mann    | *a man*   | mannen   | *the man*   |
| et barn    | *a child* | barnet   | *the child* |

For feminine-classified nouns, there is one irregularity:

| Indefinite                 |           | Definite              |             |
|:-------------------------- |:--------- |:--------------------- |:----------- |
| ei kvinne **OR** en kvinne | *a woman* | kvinna **OR** kvinnen | *the woman* |
| ei jente **OR** en jente   | *a girl*  | jenta **OR** jenten   | *the girl*  |

Both **jenta** and **jenten** are appropriate translations for *the girl*. These same endings apply to all feminine nouns.

It is also normal to use the masculine article "en" for indefinite forms, even when preferring a feminine suffix in definite. This is not considered an error!

| Indefinite |             | Definite |              |
|:---------- |:----------- |:-------- |:------------ |
| en jente   | *a girl*    | jenta    | *the girl*   |
| en øy      | *an island* | øya      | *the island* |
