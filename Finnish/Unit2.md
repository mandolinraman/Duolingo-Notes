### Mämmi, ice cream, and ketchup

The Finnish dessert known as **mämmi** is sweet rye pudding eaten especially during the Easter weeks in the spring. It is very dark and thick, so some weirdos find the way it looks unappealing. It is usually consumed with a bit of milk or cream (not whipped), sometimes with vanilla ice cream.

Finns eat **jäätelö**, “ice cream”, more than most other nations. While it is most popular during that one hot day in the summer, we eat it all year round. Sub-zero temperatures in February are considered a pitiful excuse for not having your little piece of edible heaven like a normal person.

Every other type of food is covered in **ketsuppi**, “ketchup”, which like coffee and ice cream is unusually popular in Finland. Any self-respecting grocer keeps several shelves of one kilogram ketchup bottles in their shop. Whatever bits of your food on your plate are visible from under all the ketchup are there so that you can put mustard on them.

### THE END IS NIGH

If you run out of ice cream, it is the end of your world. The Finnish word **loppu**, “the end”, is used to signify that there is nothing left of something.

> **Jäätelö on loppu.**
> The ice cream is all gone. **OR** I am/You are/He is/She is/It is/We are/They are out of ice cream.
> 
> **Ketsuppi on loppu.**
> The ketchup is all gone. **OR** I am/You are/He is/She is/It is/We are/They are out of ketchup.

### Play your part(itive)

The dictionary forms of nominals (nouns, adjectives, pronouns, and numerals) are in the nominative case. However, Finnish nominals can be inflected in 14 other cases besides the nominative. Such as (*drumroll*) **THE PARTITIVE** (*ta-da*). The partitive has many uses, but **its main purpose is to signify something that is incomplete, unfinished, or hard to specify - things that are a PART of something**. The partitive case is used most often (although not always) with **objects and predicatives**.

There are several ways of forming the partitive singular, but the simplest way to do it is also the most common one and applies to most words: **you add an A at the end**.

> **ketsuppi + a -> ketsuppia**
> **kala + a -> kalaa**

### If you cannot count it, how do you know whether you have all of it?

**Uncountable nouns** fall into the hard-to-specify category, because you cannot specify how many of something there is. **Any uncountable noun that is a predicative is in the partitive singular**.

> **Se on mehua.**
> It is juice.
> 
> **Onko tuo maitoa?**
> Is that milk?

**Any uncountable noun that is a direct object is in the partitive singular**. You can often add the word “some” (statements) or “any” (questions) in front of a noun like this in the English translation.

> **Minulla on ketsuppia.**
> I have (some) ketchup.
> 
> **Onko sinulla juustoa?**
> Do you have (any) cheese?

**Any adjective referring to an uncountable noun is also in the partitive singular in predicative and object positions**.

> **Tämä on outoa mehua.**
> This is strange juice.
> 
> **Meillä on mustaa limonadia.**
> We have (some) black soda pop.

In fact, **if an adjective appears alone as a predicative, it is in the partitive singular whenever the subject it refers to is an uncountable noun**.

> **Onko mämmi oranssia?**
> Is (the) mämmi orange?
> 
> **Ei, mämmi on mustaa.**
> No, (the) mämmi is black.

### Amounts

**A word referring to a single unit of some amount is in the nominative** in short phrases and following “to be” and “to have”. Yet, **any uncountable noun that follows a word referring to an amount is in the partitive**. You can count the units, but you still cannot count something that is uncountable. A unit like this can be an exact scientific unit like **kilo**, or a more everyday measurement like **pullo**, “bottle”.

> **Kilo lihaa, kiitos.**
> A kilo of (some) meat, please.
> 
> **Pullo mehua, kiitos.**
> A bottle of (some) juice, please.

An amount like this can also be exact in a more subjective manner, as with words like **tarpeeksi**, “enough”, and **liikaa**, “too much”. You know when you have had enough (or at least you should).

> **Onko meillä tarpeeksi kalaa?**
> Do we have enough fish?

### Liian or liikaa?

The determiner **liian**, “too”, is a general intensifier that can be used with almost anything: colors, taste, the quality of your local grocer's ketchup, etc. The determiner **liikaa**, “too much”, refers specifically to an excessive amount of something.

> **Tämä mehu on liian makeaa.**
> This juice is too sweet.
> 
> **Meillä on liikaa juustoa.**
> We have too much cheese.

### Let’s parti(tive)!

Finnish has 15 grammatical cases that are used with the nominals (nouns, adjectives, pronouns, and numerals) and sometimes even with other word classes. The dictionary forms of nominals are in **the nominative** case. Another proud member of the Finnish Case Club for Terms Ending in -IVE is **THE PARTITIVE**. It has many uses, but **its main purpose is to tell you that something is somehow incomplete, unfinished, or hard to specify**. The partitive case is used most often (although not always) with **objects and predicatives**.

While there are several ways of forming the partitive singular, the simplest way to do it applies to most Finnish words: **you add an extra A at the end of the word**.

> **sana + a -> sanaa**
> **aksentti + a -> aksenttia**

### Partitive verbs

Finnish has several grammatical cases which can appear in the object position, depending on what you are trying to say. **Some verbs prefer partitive objects** in certain contexts. **puhua**, “to speak”, is one such verb. **Whenever you tell someone what languages you can or cannot speak, you need the names of the languages in the partitive**. After all, no one is able to speak a whole language. There will always be words that you do not know even in your native language. And even if you happen to be an ancient wizard who knows everything, you cannot utter the entirety of a language all at once.

> **Opettaja puhuu koreaa.**
> The teacher speaks/is speaking Korean.
> 
> **Puhuuko turisti ranskaa?**
> Does the tourist speak/Is the tourist speaking French?

While most language names are relatively new loanwords, **suomi**, the word for the Finnish language, is as old as pro-level wizards. **Old nouns and adjectives that end in I go through a stem change: I turns into E**. Words that end in I but are still very young, only the age of upstart wizards whose age is counted in hundreds and not in thousands, keep I at the end of their stems.

> englanti: **englanti +a -> englantia**
> suomi: **suome + a -> suomea**
> 
> **Anteeksi, puhutko sinä suomea?**
> Excuse me, do you speak/are you speaking Finnish?

### OR or OR?

The Finnish language has two words for “or”: **tai**, the inclusive “or”, and **vai**, the exclusive “or”. **vai** can only be used in questions, so you have to go with **tai** in statements.

A statement with **tai** can mean that all options offered are possible, or that only one of them is possible. If the latter, English sometimes emphasizes these limited possibilities by adding “either” before the list of options.

> **Tuo on suomea tai viroa.**
> That is (either) Finnish or Estonian.

In questions, both **tai** and **vai** are possible, depending on what you want to say. **VAI is used when you know there is only one possible answer. TAI is used when you want to keep your options open: any one of the options could be correct, or both of them, or neither.** You can sometimes see this reflected in the verb form of the English translation.

> **Anteeksi, puhutteko te englantia tai espanjaa?**
> Excuse me, do you speak English or Spanish?
> 
> **Anteeksi, puhutteko te suomea vai viroa?**
> Excuse me, are you speaking Finnish or Estonian?

If you use the inclusive **tai**, you must be talking about knowledge of languages. Maybe the people speak both English and Spanish, just one of them, or neither. Or maybe one of them knows Spanish and another one English. You have no way of knowing. If you use the exclusive **vai**, you must be commenting on what you are hearing. The language spoken sounds very familiar to you, but you have not yet progressed far enough in your Finnish studies to know whether it is Finnish or Estonian, although you know it has to be one or the other.

### Singularly many

The pronoun **moni**, “many”, is inflected in both number and case. This means **it has a singular form, which is followed by a verb in the singular**, although in the corresponding English translation both are in the plural. If **moni**, the nominative singular form of the word, begins a sentence, you are dealing with a **generalisation**. Therefore, the continuous form (ing form) of the verb is not possible in the English translation. If you have trouble sticking to the singular, the now old-fashioned structure **many a + noun** may be of some assistance. As in “many a wordy jest”, an expression found in *A Christmas Carol* by Charles Dickens.

> **Moni suomalainen puhuu sujuvaa englantia.**
> Many Finns speak fluent English/Many a Finn speaks fluent English.

### ATAboy!

Finnish verbs can be conjugated in several different ways depending on the verb type, but **the endings are always the same**.

| Pronoun | Verb ending          |
|:------- |:-------------------- |
| minä    | -n                   |
| sinä    | -t                   |
| hän     | -VV (long vowel)     |
| me      | -mme                 |
| te      | -tte                 |
| he      | -vVt (v + vowel + t) |

If the 1st infinitive of the verb ends in -ata, -ota, or -uta, the stem is formed by removing the T in the middle.

> to paint: **maalata** -> **maalaa-**
> to clean: **siivota** -> **siivoa-**
> to realize: **tajuta** -> **tajua-**

Then you add the personal endings.

| Pronoun | Verb       | English                                 |
|:------- |:---------- |:--------------------------------------- |
| minä    | siivoa-n   | I am cleaning, I clean                  |
| sinä    | siivoa-t   | you are cleaning, you clean             |
| hän     | siivoa-a   | s/he is cleaning, s/he cleans           |
| me      | siivoa-mme | we are cleaning, we clean               |
| te      | siivoa-tte | you (all) are cleaning, you (all) clean |
| he      | siivoa-vat | they are cleaning, they clean           |

The question particle is added after the personal ending.

> **Maalaako Aino usein?**
> Does Aino paint often?

### I object!

If something is the focus of your actions, it’s called an object. If you’re still in the process of doing something to that object, you’ll need the partitive case. **Objects of ongoing actions are in the partitive case.** The object form rarely has any influence on whether you should use the definite or indefinite article in the English translation. In English, ongoing action is expressed by using the verb, not the noun as in Finnish. This is why Finnish sentences with a partitive object are usually translated with the continuous form of the verb, the -ing form.

> **Me siivoamme taloa.**
> We’re cleaning a/the house.
> 
> **Mummo korjaa autoa.**
> Grandma is repairing/fixing a/the car.

If the noun is preceded by an adjective, it must be in the partitive as well.

> **Mummo korjaa mustaa autoa.**
> Grandma is repairing/fixing a/the black car.

### Which “that” is that?

In the English language the conjunction “that” never follows a comma. It’s Finnish equivalent **että**, however, would die were it seen without an admiring comma by its side. It also likes YOUR attention more than the humble English “that”. “that” rarely complains if it’s cut out of the sentence completely. **että**, the vain drama queen, on the other hand, has its revenge on you by turning your sentence nonsensical should you choose to ignore it. What a diva!

> **Tajuan nyt, että teillä on jo koira.**
> I realize now (that) you already have a dog.

The conjunction **koska** always appears with a comma too, even though its English cousin “because” chooses not to favor its punctuation companion's company as often.

> **Siivoan verantaa, koska se on sotkuinen.**
> I’m cleaning the veranda, because it is messy.

### Cleaning and decorating

The verb **siivota** is “to clean” only in the meaning “to tidy things up”. It’s used when you're talking about everyday chores **in general** whether that’s hoovering or picking toys off the floor. If you need to clean something very specific and relatively small, like the bathtub, a windscreen, or a spatula, you should opt for some other verb. You shouldn’t use **siivota** with parts of the human body either.

> **He siivoavat vanhaa asuntoa.**
> They are cleaning/tidying up the old apartment.

The noun **taulu** refers to a picture you can hang on your wall. It can be a painting, a drawing, a framed photograph, or some fabric stapled on a piece of styrofoam. As long as it’s a flat thing that cannot be bent easily, it required some creative output to get made, and it hangs on a wall, it’s **taulu**.

### Don’t sweat it!

Sweating, like being cold or hungry, is something you have, not something you are or do. Finns usually “have a sweat” rather than just “sweat”.

> **Minulla on hiki.**
> I am sweating.
> 
> **Minulla on kylmä/kuuma/lämmin/nälkä/jano.**
> I am cold/hot/warm/hungry/thirsty.

# Know-How

### Knowledge is power

**The verb OSATA means “to know how to” or “to have knowledge of”.** English uses various constructions to express the same thing depending on the context. When the verb *osata* is followed by a language, the verb “to know” is the best translation.

> **Osaatko sinä suomea?**
> Do you know Finnish?

If the focus is on speaking rather than knowledge of the language in general, *osata* is followed by the 1st infinitive *puhua*, “to speak”. Here English favors the modal verb “can”, although “to know how to” works often too.

> **Osaan puhua ranskaa.**
> I can/know how to speak French.

You can place **the 1st infinitive form** of many verbs after *osata*.

> **Joni osaa lukea/laulaa.**
> Joni can/knows how to read/sing.

**OSATA is all about knowledge, talent, and acquired skills**, which is why you should **NOT** assume that every “can” in the English language is translated with *osata*. The English verb is also used to ask for favors (“Can you come over here?”) and to check if someone is able or capable of doing something (“Can you hear me?”). Finnish uses other structures to express such things. When you ask a parent whether their child can walk yet, *osata* is the verb to go with. It takes a lot of work, quite a bit of natural talent, and lots of knowledge acquired by failing repeatedly to learn how to walk. If you’re helping someone who has been hit by a car, using *osata* when posing the same question would sound like asking whether this person ever learned to walk to begin with, when you probably meant to ask if they are capable of walking.

> **Osaako lapsi puhua?**
> Can the child/Does the child know how to speak?

### Both-and

Just in case you’re wondering why you can’t see the word *ja*, “and”, anywhere in this section: **what in English is “both-and”, is “also-that” in Finnish**. Both the English structure and the Finnish **sekä-että** are used to point out **the importance of there not being only this one thing here but two things**, as in this very sentence. Much as in English, if you put the emphasis on *että* (“and”) in speech, the latter thing sounds more important than the first one.

> **Puhun sekä suomea että ruotsia.**
> I speak both Finnish and Swedish.
> 
> **Osaat sekä tanssia että laulaa.**
> You can both dance and sing.

### How about that!

Finnish question words begin with either M or K.

| Question word |                 |
|:------------- |:--------------- |
| mikä          | what, which     |
| missä         | where, in which |
| miksi         | why, into which |
| millainen     | what kind of    |
| kuka          | who             |
| kuinka        | how             |

The question word *kuinka*, "how", can be combined with expressions of amount and frequency, such as the word *moni*, “many”. Although the English “how many” is in the plural, the Finnish expression *kuinka moni* is in the singular.

> **Kuinka moni kanadalainen osaa ranskaa?**
> How many Canadians know French?

### Movers and shakers

Do you need a word for a profession? Or perhaps a word for a talent? **If you need a “doer”, the most common way to turn a verb into a noun is to attach the ending -JA onto a verb stem**. This is the Finnish equivalent of the English ending *-(e)r*.

> **laula + ja = laulaja** singer
> **tanssi + ja = tanssija** dancer

### Adverbs or something else?

The hint is in the name: ad+verb = adverb. **Adverbs refer to a verb**.

| Root  |                  | Adverb  |                               |
|:----- |:---------------- |:------- |:----------------------------- |
| hyvä  | good             | hyvin   | well                          |
| oikea | right, correct   | oikein  | in the right way, correctly   |
| väärä | wrong, incorrect | väärin  | in the wrong way, incorrectly |
| usea  | several          | usein   | often                         |
| harva | few              | harvoin | rarely                        |

Above are five common adverbs created by using the instructive forms of three adjectives and two pronouns/determiners. **The instructive ending -in**, meaning “with some things”, is particularly common in adverbs of frequency. The literal meaning of *hyvin*, “well”, is “with good things”. *usein*, “often”, could be translated as “on several occasions”.

> **Matti laulaa hyvin.**
> Matti sings well.

### Hush!

Unusually, you need the adjective “quiet” rather than the adverb “quietly” if you want someone to shut their cakehole. In English, that is. Finnish chooses the adverb, **hiljaa**, instead of the adjective **hiljainen**. The accompanying interjection is **hys**.

> **Hys! Hiljaa! Anna laulaa.**
> Hush/Shh! Quiet! Anna is singing.

### So long folks!

The most likely translation of the word **pitkä** is “long”. However, it also means “tall” when you’re talking about people.

> **Pitkä mies laulaa pitkää laulua.**
> The tall man is singing a long song.

### Glögi and dark bread

**Glögi** is a hot drink enjoyed in the winter, especially during the Christmas holidays. Originally, it was usually spicy mulled wine or spirits but nowadays it’s more common to drink a version made out of grape or apple juice with no or very little alcohol in it. The most common spices found in glögi are cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, and ginger. Glögi is typically sweeter than Glühwein and other similar drinks. It’s served with raisins and almonds. It's often drunk out of glasses designed specifically for the purpose. The traditional glass type resembles Russian tea glasses with metal holders.

**Tumma leipä**, “dark bread”, is a more formal way of referring to rye bread. Its plural form, **tummat leivät**, is something you can see on a sign at a Finnish grocer’s so that you can separate the good stuff from white bread. Finns tend to prefer rye bread over wheat bread. Oat bread is also very popular.

### Peace and harmony

The Finnish language has three types of vowels: back vowels, front vowels, and neutral (front) vowels.

| Vowel type             | Vowels |
|:---------------------- |:------ |
| Back vowels            | A O U  |
| Front vowels           | Y Ä Ö  |
| Neutral (front) vowels | E I    |

**Back and front vowels CANNOT appear in the same word, whereas neutral vowels can appear in words with both!** This is known as **VOWEL HARMONY**. The most common exceptions to this rule are compound words, words with prefixes, and fairly recent loanwords.

### Partial to harmony

Vowel harmony applies to most endings you can add to words, including all case endings. This means that a word like *glögi* with no back vowels cannot end in A in the partitive case, unlike a word like *kahvi*. This is why words like *glögi* end in Ä in the partitive.

> **1)** If a word has one or more back vowels (A, O, U) in it, it gets the ending with a back vowel in the partitive singular: A.
> **2)** If a word has one or more front vowels (Y, Ä, Ö) in it, it gets the ending with a front vowel in the partitive singular: Ä.

This is what it looks like in practice:

> **kuuma kahvi -> kuumaa kahvia** hot coffee
> **kylmä jäätelö -> kylmää jäätelöä** cold ice cream

### Which what?

When a question word stands in for a subject or a predicative, it’s in the nominative; **when a question word stands in for an object, it’s often in the partitive**. **mikä** is used when you’re looking for a non-human subject/predicative for your sentence; **MITÄ** is used when you need an unspecified non-human object.

> **– Mikä tuo on? – Se on kuppi.**
> – What’s that? – It’s a cup.
> 
> **– Mitä haluat? – Haluan kahvia.**
> – What do you want? – I want coffee.

### We want more!

**haluta**, “to want”, is followed by the 1st infinitive form of a verb and an object form of a nominal.

> **Haluan syödä jäätelöä.**
> I want to eat ice cream.

**jotain** is the partitive form of the Finnish version of “something”. When you combine it with the partitive forms of **juotava** and **syötävä**, “drinkable” and ”edible”, you get a phrase that you're very likely to hear in a restaurant and when you’re visiting someone’s home: **jotain juotavaa/syötävää**, "something to drink/eat".

> **Haluatko jotain juotavaa/syötävää?**
> Do you want something to drink/eat?

You can also add the very -ble pair to other expressions of amount like **lisää**, "more".

> **Haluatteko lisää juotavaa?**
> Do you want something more to drink?

### A piece of cake!

The Finnish word **pala** is a generic word for a piece of something. It can be translated as "piece", "morsel", or "slice" depending on the context.

> **Pala kakkua, kiitos.**
> A piece of cake, please.
