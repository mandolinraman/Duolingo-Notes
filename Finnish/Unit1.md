# Hello!

### Tervetuloa! Welcome!

Finnish is a proud member of the Finno-Ugric language family and, therefore, not related to the English language. It has no articles, no future tense, nor many other features found in so many European languages. It is a pretty regular language. Its spelling rules are so simple that Finnish children never have to worry about participating in spelling bee competitions. There, quite simply, is no need for them.

### Vowels

The Finnish vowels always sound the same regardless of their place in the word. The instructions refer to General American English unless stated otherwise.

|:---- |:--- |:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |:--------------------------------------------- |
| A    | [ɑ] | as in "p**a**lm tree"; never as in "h**a**t"                                                                                                                                                                                 | **a**bsurdi, p**a**lmu, utopi**a**            |
| E    | [e] | like the first E in the Australian English (GA) and British English (RP) "l**e**gend"                                                                                                                                        | **e**mu, g**e**nr**e**, l**e**g**e**nda       |
| I    | [i] | pronounced like the letter Y in "galler**y**"                                                                                                                                                                                | **i**dol**i**, galler**i**a                   |
| O, Å | [o] | almost like the letter O in "c**o**rny" but more closed, never as in "n**o**t g**o**ld"; the letter Å, the "Swedish O", is used only in names of Swedish origin                                                              | k**o**rni, **o**peretti, studi**o**, M**å**ns |
| U    | [u] | as in ”m**oo**se tab**oo**" but short                                                                                                                                                                                        | **u**rbaani, p**u**l**u**, tab**u**           |
| Y    | [y] | the "French U" and the "German Ü"; close to the expression of disgust ”**eww**”, but short and pronounced in the front part of the mouth; start with the vowel sound in the word "sea" and then pout like a proud pufferfish | **y**ksi, t**y**l**y**, h**y**eena            |
| Ä    | [æ] | like the letter a in "b**a**nd"                                                                                                                                                                                              | **ä**ss**ä**, b**ä**ndi                       |
| Ö    | [ø] | the closest thing found in English can be heard in some words before R, as in ”**ea**rly b**i**rd”; the Finnish sound is pronounced closer to the teeth                                                                      | s**ö**p**ö**, **ö**t**ö**kkä                  |

The dots above Ä and Ö are **NOT** accents nor stress marks used to modify A and O. The two letters stand for distinct sounds made in the front part of the mouth, whereas the sounds represented by the dotless letters are produced at the back. Forgetting your dots results either in incomprehensible gobbledygook or in some wholly unrelated word. It is better to tell someone that they are *hellä* (tender, gentle) than to call them *hella* (kitchen stove).

### GOOOOAAAAL!

**Long vowels** are written with double letters. They are the same sounds as the single letter ones but longer. If you get the length wrong, there is a risk of either being misunderstood or not being understood at all. If your biology paper is *tuulessa*, the wind has caught it. If it is *tulessa*, it is on fire. If your language doesn’t have a long sound found in Finnish, a good way to practice is to take the corresponding short sound and stretch it like an excited sports announcer after a goal or a touchdown.

|:--- |:---- |:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |:--------------------------------------- |
| AA  | [ɑː] | as in ”**Aa**rgh!” and the British English (RP) ”b**ar**"                                                       | b**aa**ri, **aa**ria, hurr**aa**        |
| EE  | [eː] | never as in ”sw**ee**t dr**ea**ms”, but a British (RP) soccer announcer shouting the name ”Best” - ”B**ee**st!” | **ee**ppinen, toff**ee**, magn**ee**tti |
| II  | [iː] | as in ”t**ea**m”                                                                                                | **ii**limato, t**ii**mi, kir**ii**      |
| OO  | [oː] | Australian (GA) rugby announcer yelling the name ”George” - ”G**eoo**rge!”                                      | **oo**ppera, virtu**oo**si, neul**oo**  |
| UU  | [uː] | as in ”b**oo**m” and ”vac**uu**m”                                                                               | vak**uu**mi, b**uu**mi                  |
| YY  | [yː] | as in the German "k**üh**l"; similar to "**eww**" but closer to the teeth                                       | vol**yy**mi, titit**yy**                |
| ÄÄ  | [æː] | baseball announcer hollering ”Mantle” - ”M**aa**ntle!”                                                          | v**ää**rä, **ää**ni, b**ää**            |
| ÖÖ  | [øː] | basketball announcer shouting ”Erving” - ”**Ee**rving!”; the Finnish sound is closer to the teeth               | insin**öö**ri, milj**öö**               |

Foreign names and loanwords sometimes defy these rules. For example, *Chile* has a long I in the middle and *duo* has a long U.

### Who are you?

The word for "I" is **minä** and for "you" **sinä**. Finnish verbs are conjugated according to person and number. Here are two forms of the verb **olla**, "to be":

| Pronoun |     | Verb |     |
|:------- |:--- |:---- |:--- |
| minä    | I   | olen | am  |
| sinä    | you | olet | are |

Finns rarely use the expression "my name is". Instead we simply say "I am". The quintessential Finnish word for "hello" is **terve**, literally "healthy".

> **Terve! Minä olen Väinö.**
> Hello! I am Väinö.
> 
> **Sinä olet Aino.**
> You are Aino.

The question word **kuka**, "who", is followed by words in the same order as if they were in a statement.

> **Terve! Kuka sinä olet?**
> Hello! Who are you?

### Sorry and thank you

Finnish does not have separate, short expressions for "sorry" and "excuse me". Both are translated with **anteeksi**. The word for "thank you " is **kiitos**.

> **Anteeksi, kuka sinä olet?**
> Excuse me, who are you?
> 
> **Anteeksi Elsa.**
> Sorry Elsa.
> 
> **Kiitos!**
> Thank you!

# Good Luck!

### Consonants

Let's aspire to not aspirate. **Aspiration** is a feature in Germanic languages, which can be found in most varieties of English. It means releasing a concise but violent puff of air while producing the sounds [k], [p], and [t] beginning stressed syllables, as in *kind*, *pampered*, *tomcat*. However, when one of these three sounds appears after the sound [s], or ends a syllable, the sounds are **unaspirated**, as in *skydiving*, *wasp*, *stung*, or *Mick*, *lip*, *fat*. In Finnish, [k], [p], and [t] are **always unaspirated** regardless of their place in the word. Native English speakers from India, Pakistan, and some parts of Africa often pronounce the sounds like Finns do - no huffing and puffing.

### Seeing double

**Long consonant sounds** are marked by double letters or ng. The Finnish double letter sounds are very similar to those found in Italian. Splitting words with long consonants into syllables usually helps those with trouble pronouncing them: *alt-to*, *mok-ka*, *karamel-li*, *bas-so*.

In spoken language and some loanwords BB, DD, FF, GG, HH, JJ, and VV are also possible.

### Good luck and congratulations!

The Finnish expressions **onnea** and **paljon onnea** can be used both to wish someone good luck and to congratulate them.

> **Tervetuloa ja onnea!**
> Welcome and good luck/congratulations!
> 
> **Paljon onnea Matti!**
> Congratulations/Best wishes Matti!

### Well, hello there!

The word **no** is a filler word used to make moving from one topic to another less awkward, or to make something less formal and in your face. It is usually translated as "well".

> **No, terve! Minä olen Otso. Kukas sinä olet?**
> Well, hello! I am Otso. Who are you?
> 
> **Minä olen Anna. No, tervetuloa!**
> I am Anna. Well, welcome!

# Basics 1

### Hän

The Finnish language has no gender specific pronouns like "he" and "she" in English. Whatever the gender of the person you are talking about, they are referred to as **hän** in the singular.

> **Hän on Matti.**
> He is Matti.
> 
> **Hän on Liisa.**
> She is Liisa.

### To be in order

There are no articles in Finnish. That does not mean that you can put any old article in the English translation of a Finnish sentence. Sentences with the verb *olla*, "to be", put nouns in a certain order. The more important and complete something is, the earlier it appears. If a noun ends the sentence, it is somehow incomplete, often because the word does not include everything it by definition could. This is why **final nouns in sentences with the verb "to be" are translated with an indefinite article**.

> **Liisa on nainen.**
> Liisa is a woman.
> 
> **Matti on mies.**
> Matti is a man.
> 
> **Hän on velho.**
> S/he is a wizard.

### Name is not an omen

Unlike in many other European languages, the last letter of a first name says nothing about the gender preferences associated with that name. There are also some names that have no preferred gender. Here are the first names introduced in this course:

| Man    | Woman | Neutral |
|:------ |:----- |:------- |
| Matti  | Liisa | Kaino   |
| Väinö  | Aino  | Vieno   |
| Otso   | Elsa  | Lumi    |
| Joni   | Anna  |         |
| Pyry   | Tyyne |         |
| Miikka | Roosa |         |
| Leo    | Kaisa |         |

### Happily married

Finnish **diphthongs and vowel unions** are blissfully happy. The letters in them represent the same sounds they stand for on their own. For example,

> **a + u = au**
> [ɑ] + [u] = [ɑu].

### Stressed for success

In words that have three or fewer syllables, the stress is always on the first syllable. Unlike in English, the place of the stress does not affect the quality of the sounds.

> **lap**-si
> **kau**-nis
> **ko**-me-a
> **mu**-ka-va

This applies to Standard Finnish and many of the southern dialects. Most other forms of Finnish are considerably "bouncier".

# Basics 2

### Sisu, sauna, and kantele

**Sisu** is the secret, internal emergency generator that keeps you going when you have used up all your energy but there are still things left that just need to be done. The word is often considered untranslatable, but the American expression "true grit" gets pretty close. The corresponding adjective is **sisukas**.

> **Hilla on sisukas nainen.**
> Hilla is a woman with sisu/true grit.

**Sauna** is the most widely spread Finnish word. Although what constitutes as a sauna in most places, is considered in Finland a room that is slightly warmer than usual. Moreover, if you are not allowed to throw water on the sauna stove, it is not a proper sauna.

**Kantele** is a Finnish string instrument with a distinctive jingling sound. The first one was built by the great wizard Väinämöinen out of the jawbone of a gargantuan pike. Fact.

------

### To be

The singular present tense forms of **olla**, "to be":

| Finnish | English   |
|:------- |:--------- |
| olen    | (I) am    |
| olet    | (you) are |
| on      | (s/he) is |

In Standard Finnish, the words **minä**, "I", and **sinä**, the singular "you", are **optional** when they are in the subject position. **Hän**, however, needs to be included.

> **Minä olen ujo./Olen ujo.**
> I am shy.
> 
> **Sinä olet rehellinen./Olet rehellinen.**
> You are honest.
> 
> **Hän on hiljainen.**
> S/he is quiet.

Although common in writing, leaving out personal pronouns is rarer in spoken Finnish.

### Order!

In sentences with the verb **olla**, "to be", the more complete a noun is, the earlier it appears. The later a noun appears, the less complete it is, and the more likely it is to be translated with an indefinite article.

> **Hän on ujo poika.**
> He is a shy boy.

However, the English language has so many ways of using articles in **generalisations** that sometimes an indefinite article starts such a sentence.

> **Hyvä sauna on aina suomalainen.**
> A good sauna is always Finnish.

In Finnish, that sauna is considered complete, since we are talking about all the good saunas in the world here.

### Family names

Finnish last names can usually be found in nature. The most common last names can be divided into four groups:

| Last name  | Notes                                                                                           |
|:---------- |:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pöllö      | "Owl" - noun                                                                                    |
| Pöllönen   | "Of Owl", or "Little Owl" - noun with the ending *nen*                                          |
| Pöllölä    | "Owl Place" - noun with the ending *la/lä*                                                      |
| Pöllövaara | "Owl Fell/Hill/Danger" - compound word that has probably replaced a name in some other language |

### Knowing me, knowing you

The shortest way to introduce someone is to use the phrase **Tämä on...**, "This is..":

> **Joni, tämä on Anna.**
> Joni, this is Anna.

Finns are very informal, but just in case you get invited to the Presidential Independence Day Ball, or to some other very formal event, the Finnish equivalents of "Mr." and "Ms." are **herra** and **rouva**.

> **Herra Presidentti, tämä on rouva Pöllönen.**
> Mr. President, this is Ms. Pöllönen.

### Bravo!

The word **hyvä**, "good", can be used in the meaning "bravo" to encourage other people. You can use it to support your country or friend at a sporting event, or to thank someone for work well done.

> **Hyvä Suomi!**
> Go (Team) Finland!
> 
> **Hyvä Aino!**
> Well done Aino!/Bravo Aino!/Go Aino!

# Pets and Domestic Animals 1

### It and this

The word for "it" is **se** and the word for "this" is **tämä**. As in English, the latter can be used both independently and before a noun.

> **Se on pupu.**
> It is a bunny.
> 
> **Tämä on söpö.**
> This (one) is cute.
> 
> **Tämä pupu on söpö.**
> This bunny is cute.

### To have

Finnish does not have a verb for "to have". Instead the verb **olla**, "to be", is combined with a subject in the **adessive**. You can recognise the adessive from the ending *lla/llä*.

| Person           | Nominative | Adessive | English |
|:---------------- |:---------- |:-------- |:------- |
| **1st singular** | minä       | minulla  | *I*     |
| **2nd singular** | sinä       | sinulla  | *you*   |
| **3rd singular** | hän        | hänellä  | *s/he*  |

Sentences with **olla** follow the most-complete-noun-first rule, which is **why an object ending the English translation is almost always translated with an indefinite article**. Whenever the noun follows the verb, the verb always takes the same form: the 3rd person singular, **on**.

> **Minulla on koira.**
> I have a dog.
> 
> **Sinulla on pupu.**
> You have a bunny.
> 
> **Hänellä on kissa.**
> S/he has a cat.

### What kind of

In questions that begin with **millainen**, "what kind of"/"what...like", the verb is placed after the nouns and pronouns.

> **Millainen poni se on?**
> What kind of pony is it/What is the pony like?
> 
> **Millainen koira sinulla on?**
> What kind of dog do you have/What is your dog like?

### Incorrect!

The word **väärin**, meaning "wrong" or "incorrect", is an adverb, which is why it always appears independently and never attaches itself to a noun.

> **Väärin, se on undulaatti.**
> Wrong, it is a parakeet.

### Good dog!

Grownup people are always (fingers crossed) *hyvä*, "good". However, Finns use the word *kiltti*, more literally "kind" or "well-behaved", instead of *hyvä* when talking about children and animals. While some people may use both when talking to their pets, children are almost always *kiltti*.

> **Joni on hyvä mies.**
> Joni is a good man.
> 
> **Kuka on kiltti koira?**
> Who is a good dog?

### Colour my world

In this skill, you will be introduced to the first colour words in this course: blue, white, and some of the rest (which are not found in the most beautiful flag in the world).

| Finnish   | English |
|:--------- |:------- |
| sininen   | blue    |
| valkoinen | white   |
| musta     | black   |
| vihreä    | green   |

### Animal names

You can find these common Finnish names for pets and domestic animals in this course:

| Name     | Animal |
|:-------- |:------ |
| Musti    | dog    |
| Mirri    | cat    |
| Polle    | horse  |
| Mansikki | cow    |

### Words are wind

Whenever **the letter H** appears in some other place than the beginning of the word, it should be pronounced more violently, or the listener may interpret it as a long vowel, or not notice it at all. They may think that you are lamenting how quickly the past few weeks, *viikot*, have gone, when you actually need new notebooks, *vihkot*. Or that you are going to visit your friend Pia instead of going to your yard, *piha*. To find the right sounds, imitate the wind howling on a snowy plain and observe how the movement of air changes the sound.

| H   | [x] | formed between the soft spot at the back the mouth's ceiling and the back of the tongue; preceded by A, O, or U, and followed by a consonant; can be found in the Scottish "lo**ch**" and the German "Ba**ch**" | ka**h**vi, so**h**va, ju**h**la |

# The North

### The most northern North

The word **saamelainen** (*Sápme* in Northern Sámi) refers to the Sámi people who live in the northern parts of Finland, Norway, and Sweden, as well as in the most northwestern Russia. Three Sámi languages (Northern Sámi, Inari Sámi, Skolt Sámi) are spoken in Finland and they have a semi-official status. This means that a Sámi language is an official language in any municipality that has a certain number of native speakers. Four Finnish municipalities offer services in at least one Sámi language.

### Orderly conduct

The more complete a noun is, the earlier it appears in a sentence with the verb **olla**, "to be". As a result, **a noun or a noun phrase that starts a sentence is usually translated with a definite article.** If the sentence has another noun with another function, that noun is less complete. It can be translated with both types of articles found in English, depending on the context. The indefinite article is the more likely option in most cases.

> **Tuhma kissa on viikinki.**
> The naughty cat is a/the Viking.

If the previous conversation has revolved around the identity of a mysterious Viking, whose scandalous secret is now being revealed, the definite article is used. In other cases, use an indefinite article. Note that this is because the English language works the way it works. Finnish could not care less. As long as there are cats and Vikings involved, in that order, everything is hunky-dory.

### So many questions

Most Finnish **question words** are followed by words **in the same order as they would be in a statement**: the subject first, then the verb. This also applies to the question word **missä**, "(in) where":

> **Norja on maa.**
> Norway is a country.
> 
> **Missä Norja on?**
> Where is Norway?

### Yes/No

Unlike English, Finnish does not use auxiliary verbs like "to do" to start questions but opts for a question particle instead. In yes/no questions, **the particle -ko is added to the word that is in charge of the interrogation**. Most often this word is a verb. The verb is followed by the subject.

> **Onko Ruotsi kylmä maa?**
> Is Sweden a cold country?
> 
> **Onko sinulla suomalainen nimi?**
> Do you have a Finnish name?

Whenever the verb **olla**, "to be", is the chief interrogator in a sentence with several nouns as different parts of the sentence, the more complete noun or noun phrase is placed first. **The first noun is usually translated with a definite and the second with an indefinite article.**

> **Onko kissa viikinki?**
> Is the cat a Viking?
> 
> **Onko viikinki kissa?**
> Is the Viking a cat?

### Nationality

Most nationality words are formed by adding **the ending -lainen** to the name of a nation. Unlike in English, nationality words in Finnish are written with **the first letter in the lower case**. For example, the word for "Icelandic" is formed like this:

> **Islanti + lainen = islantilainen**

The most common exceptions are the words **suomalainen** (Finnish, Finn), **ruotsalainen** (Swedish, Swede), and **venäläinen** (Russian). Nationality words that end in *-lainen* are used as adjectives, and in most cases also as nouns.

> **Minulla on söpö venäläinen koira.**
> I have a cute, Russian dog.
> 
> **Hän on tanskalainen.**
> S/he is a Dane.
> 
> **Islantilainen on ujo.**
> The Icelandic person is shy.

### Shh...

[ʃ] has the most irregular spelling in Finnish and is a rare sound pronounced like the first sound in "**Sh**erlock". It is usually spelled with sh (*shampoo*) but s and š are also possible (*sampoo*, *šampoo*).

> **Saamelainen mies on shamaani/samaani/šamaani.**
> The Sámi man is a shaman.

### Stress control

In words that have three syllables or fewer, the stress falls on the first syllable.

> **sau**-na
> **kan**-te-le

Words that have more syllables need **a secondary stress**. Its default place is **on the third syllable**.

> **re**-hel-**li**-nen
> **suo**-ma-**lai**-nen

In words that have five syllables or more, if the third syllable is **light** - that is, it has only one or two letters in it - but there is a longer, **heavy** syllable next to it, the stress moves to the right, **on the fourth syllable**.

> **is**-lan-ti-**lai**-nen

These rules apply to Standard Finnish and most southern varieties. Other forms of Finnish are often bouncier.

### This time it's personal

The nominative forms of the personal pronouns:

| Finnish | English   |
|:------- |:--------- |
| minä    | I         |
| sinä    | you       |
| hän     | he, she   |
| me      | we        |
| te      | you (all) |
| he      | they      |

Verbs are conjugated according to person and number. Here is the verb *olla*, "to be", in its six different present tense forms:

| Finnish | English       |
|:------- |:------------- |
| olen    | (I) am        |
| olet    | (you) are     |
| on      | (s/he, it) is |
| olemme  | (we) are      |
| olette  | (you all) are |
| ovat    | (they) are    |

Finnish makes a distinction between **the singular and the plural you**, that is, whether the discussion is about one or several people.

> **Sinä olet naimisissa.**
> You are married.
> *(you are a person who is married)*
> 
> **Aino ja Otso, te olette naimisissa.**
> Aino and Otso, you are married.
> *(you are people who are married)*

In Standard Finnish, subject pronouns in the nominative are optional in the 1st and 2nd person. They need to be included in the 3rd person (*hän, he*).

> **(Me) olemme naimisissa.**
> We are married.
> 
> **(Te) olette naimisissa.**
> You (all) are married.
> 
> **He ovat naimisissa.**
> They are married.

Verbs can be conjugated in several different ways, depending on the verb type, but **the endings are always the same**.

| Pronoun | Verb ending          |
|:------- |:-------------------- |
| minä    | -n                   |
| sinä    | -t                   |
| hän     | -VV (long vowel)     |
| me      | -mme                 |
| te      | -tte                 |
| he      | -vVt (v + vowel + t) |

If the 1st infinitive of a verb ends in two vowels, the stem is formed **by cutting out the final vowel**.

> to sing: **laulaa** -> **laula-**
> to dance: **tanssia** -> **tanssi-**
> to sit: **istua** -> **istu-**

Then you add the endings. In the 3rd person singular (with *hän*), you **double the final letter in the stem**. In the 3rd person plural (with *he*), you add **the ending -vat**, if the stem has *A*, *O*, or *U* in it.

| Pronoun | Verb      | English                               |
|:------- |:--------- |:------------------------------------- |
| minä    | laula-n   | I am singing, I sing                  |
| sinä    | laula-t   | you are singing, you sing             |
| hän     | laula-a   | s/he is singing, s/he sings           |
| me      | laula-mme | we are singing, we sing               |
| te      | laula-tte | you (all) are singing, you (all) sing |
| he      | laula-vat | they are singing, they sing           |

The question particle **-ko** is added **AFTER the personal endings**.

> **tanssi + i + ko = tanssiiko**
> **laula + t + ko = laulatko**

It is rare for a question to consist of only a verb, so using a personal pronoun with all forms is recommended, if there are no other words in the sentence.

> **Tanssiiko hän?**
> Is s/he dancing?
> 
> **Laulatko sinä?**
> Do you sing?

The continuous form of the English verb, the "-ing form", is usually the most natural translation, but the form without -ing, expressing repetitive action, can sometimes be the better option. Often, both are possible, depending on the context.

> **Istumme yhdessä.**
> We are sitting together.

The continuous form sounds better above. However, "We sit together" would be correct as an answer to a question about repetitive actions, like "What do we do on Sundays?"

> **Istumme usein yhdessä.**
> We often sit together.

The form expressing repetitive action is the most likely translation with sentences like the one above, because the sentence includes an adverb expressing frequency, "often".

> **He tanssivat.**
> They are dancing (right now)./They dance (as a hobby, etc).

Finnish often focuses on whether things are **complete or incomplete**. The sentences "They are dancing" and "They dance" both refer to incomplete, unfinished action. This is why you can translate them with the same sentence.

To put it shortly, **the way ENGLISH grammar works in the given context determines whether the -ing form is used or not.** Finnish is not particularly interested in ings.

### Like a dog with two tails

**Finnish has two adjectives that are best translated with the word "happy"**. A dog that jumps excitedly up and down when you return home after a long day at work is **iloinen**. A dog that lies relaxed next to you after his dinner while you scratch his neck is **onnellinen**. The first word is used to describe joyous and cheerful happiness that is easy to notice. The second word is used to describe happiness that is so deep that you can feel it in your bones. Of course it is possible to be both at the same time, but just because you are *onnellinen* does not necessarily mean that you are *iloinen*, or vice versa. A person can also pretend to be *iloinen*, but you cannot fake being *onnellinen*. Dogs, naturally, are incapable of such deception.

> **Musti on hiljainen ja onnellinen.**
> Musti is quiet and happy.
> 
> **Tämä iloinen vauva nauraa.**
> This happy baby is laughing.

### This and that

Finnish makes a distinction between **tämä**, "this", and **tuo**, "that". **Tämä refers to things, which are relatively close. If you are talking about concrete things, they are so close that you can touch them. Tuo is used for things that are more distant. If those things are concrete, they are still close enough for you to point at them.** In English, you can say "This is Finland" or "That's Finland" to make a general statement about a certain northern country. In Finnish, *Tämä on Suomi* and *Tuo on Suomi* are possible only if you have a globe or a map in front of you to show others what you are talking about. Despite wild rumours, Finland is very much a concrete thing, not an imaginary fantasy land. Finland is also surprisingly large, so pointing it out accurately is rather challenging, unless you have really long arms.

> **Tämä on radio.**
> This is a radio.
> 
> **Tuo on televisio.**
> That is a television.

Both **tämä** and **tuo** can also be used to define a noun that follows them. You are allowed a bit more imagination with these. You can often use **tämä** also when you are located within the concrete thing discussed.

> **Tämä talo on vanha.**
> This house is old.
> 
> **Tuo piha on kaunis.**
> That yard is beautiful.

If you need to make a distinction between two things that are equally close, **tämä** precedes **tuo**.

> **Tämä sänky on uusi ja tuo on vanha.**
> This bed is new and that one is old.

### More to have

Finnish does not have a general verb for "to have". Instead, the verb **olla**, "to be", is used with the **adessive** forms of the word that's in the subject position in the English sentence. Here are all the adessive forms of the personal pronouns:

| Person           | Finnish | English                 |
|:---------------- |:------- |:----------------------- |
| **1st singular** | minulla | I, on me                |
| **2nd singular** | sinulla | you, on you             |
| **3rd singular** | hänellä | s/he, on him/her        |
| **1st plural**   | meillä  | we, on us               |
| **2nd plural**   | teillä  | you (all), on you (all) |
| **3rd plural**   | heillä  | they, on them           |

Whenever a pronoun precedes the verb and a noun follows it, the verb takes the form, **on**. The noun is almost always translated with an indefinite article.

> **Meillä on suuri asunto.**
> We have a large apartment.

### Nice and comfy

**Mukava** is used to describe being welcoming and being easy to be around with. The translation changes depending on what the word is describing. When it is used about people and animals the word describes behaviour and "nice" is the best translation. If you are talking about a sofa, a bed, a room, or a house, "comfortable" and "comfy" are good translations.

> **Musti on mukava koira.**
> Musti is a nice dog.
> 
> **Tuo sohva on todella mukava.**
> That sofa is really comfortable.

### Behold! My stuff!

Unlike in English, **oma**, "own", often appears without the company of words like "my", "our", or "their", if the subject of the sentence reveals whose stuff we are talking about. This is why **any sentence that begins with a pronoun in the adessive does not refer to the owner for the second time.**

> **Minulla on oma huone.**
> I have a room of my own.
> 
> **Meillä on oma asunto.**
> We have an apartment of our own./We own an apartment.

Note that while the sentences above can sometimes also be translated with "I have my own room", or "We have our own apartment", the main purpose of the word **oma** is to simply express ownership and possession, so no need to be sassy.

### I thingth I hab a golb

**Nasal sounds** suffer from a really bad cold.

# Phrases 1

### Coffee and pulla

We have a problem and we are not ashamed to admit it. No other nation in the world drinks as much **kahvi**, "coffee", as the Finns do. We start in the morning and stop in the evening.

**Pulla**, or **nisu**, is a coffeebread made out of wheat flour. It has a firm texture, and while it is sweet, it does not have as much sugar as most pastries. The dough often contains cardamom. Pulla comes in many shapes and sizes, varying from small buns and rolls to large, braided loaves.

------

### Greetings!

The greeting **hei** is used for both "hi" and "bye". You can also double it when you use it in the latter meaning.

> **Hei Väinö!**
> Hi Väinö!/Bye Väinö!
> 
> **Hei hei Musti!**
> Goodbye Musti!

While Finns use the titles *rouva* (Ms.) and *herra* (Mr.) only in extremely formal situations and in the military, **referring to people using their last name only is very common**, especially among men. This can be both a very informal situation, like greeting someone, or a more formal one, like calling the name of the next patient in a waiting room.

> **Terve Pöllö!**
> Hello Pöllö!

### Behave yourself

**The Finnish language does not have a word for "please", but do not make the mistake of thinking that the lack of this one word means that Finns are rude. We simply express politeness by using other means.** We do not plead, we give thanks. The Finnish word for "thank you" is **kiitos**. You also use it the same way English speakers use the word "please" when you are asking for something at a shop, a café, or a restaurant.

> **Yksi kahvi, kiitos.**
> One coffee, please.
> 
> **Kahvi ja pulla, kiitos.**
> A coffee and a pulla, please.

Since the word means "thank you" and is therefore stronger than "please", you do not have to repeat it quite as often. **Kiitos** is also used after **ei** ("no") and **kyllä** ("yes" ).

> **Ei, kiitos.**
> No, thank you.
> 
> **Kyllä, kiitos.**
> Yes, please.

**Kyllä** is mainly used with **kiitos**, as an affirmative answer to questions that begin with **haluaisitko**, "would you like to have" and in the military. In other situations, you have two options. First, you can say **joo** or **juu** (both mean "yes", or "yeah"). The second and the more used option is **repeating the verb in the question**.

> **- Oletko sinä Pöllölä? - Olen.**
> \- Are you Pöllölä? - (Yes,) I am.
> 
> **- Onko tämä oikein? - On.**
> \- Is this correct? - (Yes,) It is.

**Ole hyvä**, literally "be good", is used **when passing objects to another person**. You are expected to answer with **kiitos**.

> **– Kahvi, ole hyvä. – Kiitos.**
> – Here you are, a coffee. – Thank you.

Notice that **ole hyvä find its place at the end of a sentence**. If you use the phrase in the beginning of a sentence, it will sound like you are addressing the coffee. The place after the expression is reserved for names. As coffee obsessed as we are, not even Finns talk to their coffee cups.

> **Ole hyvä, Anna!**
> Anna! Here you are!

### Correct!

Much like **väärin**, the word for "incorrect" and "wrong", **oikein**, the word for "correct" and "right", cannot precede a noun but always stands alone.

> **Tämä on oikein ja tuo on väärin.**
> This one is correct and that one is incorrect.

### Hot and cold

To express how people and animals experience different temperatures, you need to use **the adessive + on structure**. In other words, **Finns are not hot nor cold, we "have" hot or cold.**

> **Minulla on kuuma.**
> I am hot.
> 
> **Meillä on kylmä.**
> We are cold.

# Language 1

### Why?

The Finnish question word for "why" is **miksi**. As with most other question words, the rest of the sentence looks like a statement.

> **Suomi on tärkeä kieli.**
> Finnish is an important language.
> 
> **Miksi suomi on tärkeä kieli?**
> Why is Finnish an important language?

### Nations, nationalities, and their languages

Unlike in English, languages are not considered proper nouns in Finnish. Therefore, they start with a letter in the lower case. Most language names look identical to the name of the nation of their speakers, except for the first letter.

> **Pöllö, Suomi on maa, suomi on kieli ja hän on suomalainen.**
> Pöllö, Finland is a country, Finnish is a language, and s/he is a Finn.

### wow. such easy

The word **niin**, "so", is a quantifier that appears before an adjective or an adverb.

> **Tämä lause on niin helppo.**
> This sentence is so easy.

However, since English insists on leaving articles lying around for speakers of Finnish to trip on, "such" is often the more idiomatic translation whenever the adjective is followed by a noun.

> **Englanti on niin vaikea kieli.**
> English is so difficult a language./English is such a difficult language.

### Definitely or

The conjunction **vai**, "or", appears only in questions and is always **exclusive**, never inclusive. This means that you are expected to choose one thing as an answer to the question.

> **Onko se kieli, murre vai aksentti?**
> Is it a language, a dialect, or an accent?

### Oh really?

As in English, the adverb **todella**, "really", likes to march before the verb. It should not be confused with the determiner **todella**, "really", which precedes an adjective and has a different function.

> **Ranska todella on kaunis kieli.**
> French really is a beautiful language.
> *(Mon dieu, French is beautiful. Not pretty, nor cute, nor nice. Beautiful.)*
> 
> **Ranska on todella kaunis kieli.**
> French is a really beautiful language.
> *(Oui, French is beautiful, and not just beautiful but so beautiful that saying that it is merely beautiful would be an understatement. Oh la la...)*

### Teacher, teacher!

Finnish children do not address teachers formally. No sirs here, no ma'am! The youngest children refer to their teachers by first name. As they grow older, nicknames and last names (without a title) become more common. Usually though, a teacher is quite simply a teacher, **opettaja**, or its abbreviation, **ope**.

> **Opettaja, miksi viro on tärkeä kieli?**
> Teacher, why is Estonian an important language?

# Barbecue

### The barbecue season

An old proverb says that "the Finnish summer is short and short on snow". This is a rather sarcastic observation on the nature of spring and summer weather in Finland. The snow drifts disappear sometime in March, April, May, or June, depending on your latitude and that particular year. Then the snows return. Once, twice, thrice, umpteen times, until it is summer(ish). Whether you are a carnivore, omnivore, vegetarian, vegan, or a cannibal, the barbecue season begins when the snows have almost melted for the first time that spring. If it starts snowing when you are in the middle of grilling the sausages, tough. Now stop yapping about the weather and pass the mustard. As for when the barbecue season ends, well, since the start of the season pretty much coincides with bears waking up from hibernation, it is only natural that the end of the season takes place when the bears are starting their winter hibernation.

### Right here, right there

The Finnish system for telling whether something is here or there is more detailed than the English one. When something you can see is **tässä**, "right here", it is either exactly where you are, or at so short a distance that you can touch it without changing your pose or position. If something you can see is **tuossa**, "right there", it is just beyond your reach.

> **Lautanen on tässä.**
> The plate is right here.
> 
> **Sitruuna on tuossa.**
> The lemon is right there.

### He or ne?

English personal pronouns separate people and other entities only in the singular. You cannot call a person "it" nor can you refer to a dishwashing machine with "he" or "she". Finnish makes this distinction also in the plural.

| Number       | Human      | Non-human |
|:------------ |:---------- |:--------- |
| **Singular** | hän (s/he) | se (it)   |
| **Plural**   | he (they)  | ne (they) |

> **Missä Matti ja Liisa ovat? He ovat tuossa.**
> Where are Matti and Liisa? They are right there.
> 
> **Missä ketsuppi ja sinappi ovat? Ne ovat tässä.**
> Where are the ketchup and the mustard? They are right here.

### Peckish and parched

Finns usually use the expressions "to have hunger" and "to have thirst" should we feel peckish or parched. The **adessive** form of the subject is needed to get our basic needs heard.

> **Minulla on nälkä.**
> I am hungry.
> 
> **Meillä on jano.**
> We are thirsty.

# Sights

### More questions...

The question word for "what" is **mikä**. The word order after the word is similar to that after **millainen**, "what kind of". The predicative follows the question word, but the verb wanders to the final position to be able to loyally follow the subject.

> **Millainen museo se on?**
> What kind of museum is it?
> 
> **Mikä museo tuo on?**
> What/Which museum is that?

### Over here, over there

The Finnish language is not satisfied with having just words for "here" and "there" like English is. We prefer to know the location of things more specifically. If both you and the person you are talking to are both in the area in which whatever or whomever you are talking about is located, the word **täällä**, "over here", is used. If neither one of you is in the same area as the person or the thing discussed but they are still close enough for you to point at them, the word **tuolla**, "over there", is used instead.

> **Teatteri on täällä.**
> The theater is over here.
> 
> **Museo on tuolla.**
> The museum is over there.

### Surprise or exasperation?

In English, most situations can be handled with either the interjection "oh" or by adding something after it. While Finnish has many short expressions that can be used in various situations, we do not have a versatile exclamation that works **exactly** in the same way as "oh". If something upsetting happens to you, **voi ei** is a good way to express your general disillusionment with the way the world usually enjoys surprising us.

> **Voi ei! Museo on kiinni!**
> Oh no! The museum is closed!

If what you are feeling is surprise caused by the actions of yourself or other people, or just general weirdness of the world, **oho** is a good exclamation to use. The surprise can be positive, negative, or neutral, and be translated with "oh wow", "oh", or "wow" depending on the context. It can also be used as the equivalent of the surprised "oops" English speakers utter when they arrive at their holiday destination and realize that they bought tickets to a wrong flight and ended up in Paris, Texas, instead of Paris, France, or vice versa.

> **Oho. Outo rakennus.**
> Oh wow. A weird building.
> 
> **Oho. Väärä teatteri.**
> Oops. The wrong theater.

### The right stuff

The Finnish equivalents for "right/correct" and "wrong/incorrect" look different depending on whether they are adjectives or adverbs. You can recognise the adverbs from the ending **-in**. The adjectives can appear before nouns, but the adverbs cannot.

> **Väärin! Tämä on väärä rakennus.**
> Wrong! This is the wrong building.
> 
> **Oikein! Tuo on oikea museo.**
> Correct! That is the correct museum.

### So close, yet so far

The Finnish words for “close/near” and “far (away)” are *lähellä* and *kaukana*. You can use these two words only when you use a verb that does not imply movement from one place to another.

> **Voi ei! Kirkko on kaukana.**
> Oh no! The church is far away.
> 
> **Jee! Puisto on lähellä.**
> Yay! The park is near/nearby.
