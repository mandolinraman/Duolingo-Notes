# Basics 1

#### Welcome to the Polish for English course!

These Tips & Notes contain an overview of the concepts introduced in the skill. Studying them will give you a better understanding of the way Polish language works.

------

Before starting, please know one **crucial** thing. Despite what you may have heard, Polish **DOES NOT** have a free word order. It has a **relatively free** word order. That means that some word orders will be correct and natural, some will be 'technically not wrong, but weird', some will only suit poetry and songs, and some will simply be wrong.

In general, the new and most important piece of information lands at the end of the Polish sentence. This makes certain word orders 'technically not wrong, but weird' - some things are just a lot less likely to be stressed than others.

Another thing that the beginners often get wrong: the special character ł (capital: Ł) is a variant of L, not of T. We highly recommend using all special characters, as they are simply different letters with different pronunciation, but if you decide to not do that, please don't try writing "chtopiec" or "jabtko" with a T.

------

#### Nouns: Grammatical cases

Being an inflected language, Polish has **seven grammatical cases**. Pronouns, nouns and their accompanying adjectives take different forms that indicate their role in the sentence.

Most of the nouns you are going to encounter in this skill are in the Nominative case (shortened as *Nom.*) This “basic” case is used when the noun is the subject of the sentence – the entity that is doing something. A noun in the Nominative does not have any special ending, as it is the most basic form of the word.

Polish cases are so essential that it is often impossible to form a simple phrase without the use of cases other than the Nominative. Still, Polish people should still be able to understand you even if you happen to use a word in the incorrect case. Do not get discouraged and remember that practice makes perfect – the more you interact with the language, the better your grammar will be.

In these initial lessons you may sometimes stumble upon nouns in the Instrumental or Accusative. For now, you should be able to form basic sentences with the help of the hints attached to particular words. In the following skills we will gradually introduce you to the rules governing Polish declension.

------

#### Verbs: Present Tense

Polish verbs have **three basic tenses for indicating past, present and future**. There are some quirks to this, but we will deal with them much later. At first, you will be only using Present Tense verb forms.

**Polish verbs conjugate – they take various forms depending on the person performing the action**. The first few skills will teach you the basic rules of Polish conjugation.

Unlike in English, **there is no distinction between Present Simple and Present Continuous verbs** at the basic level (*He drinks.* vs. *He is drinking.*). Both English variants are translated into Polish exactly the same way (in this case: *On pije.*)

When translating from English, please remember not to make the relatively common mistake of treating the Present Continuous construction as two separate verbs. "He is drinking" has just one verb, you **cannot** translate it as "On jest pije", which would basically mean the same as "He is he drinks".

There are some exceptions (Present Simple and Present Continuous being translated into completely different Polish verbs), but almost all of them are Verbs of Motion and will be discussed later in this course.

------

#### Articles

**Polish does not have any articles.** Nonetheless, when translating from Polish, you have to remember to form correct English sentences. It is not acceptable to skip articles if it results in the English sentence being ungrammatical – “He is boy” is not going to be accepted.

#### Pronouns and Conjugation

Here is a table containing all Polish pronouns, along with examples of their use:

| English Pronoun                                   | Polish Pronoun | Example                              |
|:------------------------------------------------- |:-------------- |:------------------------------------ |
| I                                                 | **ja**         | *Ja lubię mleko* — I like milk.      |
| you (singular)                                    | **ty**         | *Ty lubisz mleko.* — You like milk.  |
| he                                                | **on**         | *On lubi mleko.* — He likes milk.    |
| she                                               | **ona**        | *Ona lubi mleko.* — She likes milk.  |
| it                                                | **ono**        | *Ono lubi mleko.* — It likes milk.   |
| we                                                | **my**         | *My lubimy mleko.* — We like milk.   |
| you (plural)                                      | **wy**         | *Wy lubicie mleko* — You like milk.  |
| they (**only** groups of people including a male) | **oni**        | *Oni lubią mleko.* — They like milk. |
| they (all other groups)                           | **one**        | *One lubią mleko.* — They like milk. |

Note how **verbs conjugate when the pronoun changes**. Present tense verb forms for *on*, *ona* and *ono* are always identical.

*ono* is really rarely used – mostly when referring to children when their gender is not specified, but even then it may be easier to just say "to dziecko" (this child). It **does not** work like "it" in a sentence "It is a child".

------

#### oni and one

*oni* and *one* are both translated as *they*. However, they are used in different contexts.

***oni* is used to refer to groups that contain at least one male person.** In other words, both all-male and mixed male and female groups are referred to as *oni*. We often refer to this plural category as **masculine personal**, or alternatively, **virile**.

***one* is used to refer to groups that do not contain any male persons.** As personal pronouns are relatively rarely used in Polish to denote anything else than people, that means that almost always *one* will be used for all-female groups. We call this plural category **not masculine personal**, or alternatively, **nonvirile**.

------

#### ty vs wy

Unlike standard English, Polish has a clear distinction between singular 'you' (when talking/referring to one person) and plural 'you' (when talking/referring to two or more people). What is important to remember is that unlike such languages like Russian or French, "wy" **CANNOT** be used as a formal way of addressing one person.

There are five possible ways of addressing someone formally: **pan** (*sir*), **pani** (*ma'am*), **panowie** (*gentlemen*), **panie** (*ladies*) and **państwo** (to a mixed couple/group). They use 3rd person verbs, singular or plural respectively.

Those forms are taught later in the *Formal You* skill, but it is advisable to be aware of them from the beginning, as addressing strangers informally is pretty rude in Polish - although they will likely be more forgiving to a foreigner who learns to speak their language.

------

#### Omitting pronouns

**In Polish, a sentence where the subject pronoun has been omitted is still perfectly grammatical and in fact often more natural.**

**When talking about yourself, you usually skip the *ja* pronoun, unless you want to emphasize something. The same goes for all 1st and 2nd person pronouns.**

This is because of the way conjugation works. The verb forms used with 1st and 2nd person pronouns are unique for these pronouns. Even if you omit the pronoun, the verb still reveals who the person performing the action is, so there is no need to mention it explicitly.

**Omitting 3rd person pronouns may be a bit less common.** However, as in real life you have context, it often won't be necessary to use the pronoun. A sentence like "Ma jabłko." ([He/She/It] has an apple) will be understood to refer to a subject that is already known from the context.

As there are separate 3rd person pronouns for different genders, they contain information about the gender of the subject that cannot be in any way deduced from the form of the verb.

Consequently, 3rd person pronouns cannot be ommited in sentences where the gender of the pronoun is used to differentiate between subjects, such as *On je jabłko, a ona je chleb* (*He is eating an apple and she is eating bread*).

# Common Phrases

This lesson does not introduce any new grammatical concepts, so let's use this opportunity to have an overview of Polish letters and their corresponding sounds.

------

#### Vowels

| letter | Polish example      | English approximation | IPA                       |
|:------ |:------------------- |:--------------------- |:------------------------- |
| a      | t**a**k             | c**u**t               | [a]                       |
| ą      | maj**ą**            | r**os**e              | [ɔw̃] / [ɔm] / [ɔn]       |
| e      | chl**e**b           | b**e**d               | [ɛ]                       |
| ę      | m**ę**żczyzna       | s**en**se             | [ɛw̃] / [ɛm] / [ɛn] / [ɛ] |
| i      | on**i**             | m**ee**t              | [i]                       |
| o      | mlek**o**           | p**o**re              | [ɔ]                       |
| u/ó    | l**u**bię/c**ó**rka | b**oo**t              | [u]                       |
| y      | t**y**              | ros**e**s             | [ɨ] / [ɘ̟]                |

**Note that *u* and *ó* are used to represent exactly the same sound.**

*ą* and *ę* are nasal vowels. When *ę* is the final sound of the word, the majority of native speakers pronounce it just like a normal *e*.

When *u* is preceded by a vowel, it makes the same sound as ł ([w]).

------

#### Consonants

| letter(s) | Polish example           | English approximation | IPA         |
|:--------- |:------------------------ |:--------------------- |:----------- |
| c         | dzie**c**ko              | ca**ts**              | [ʦ]         |
| ć         | by**ć**                  | **ch**eap             | [ʨ]         |
| cz        | ciaste**cz**ka           | **ch**ip              | [t͡ʂ] / [ʧ] |
| dz        | je**dz**enie             | go**ds**              | [ʣ]         |
| dź        | nie**dź**wie**dź**       | **j**eans             | [ʥ]         |
| dż        | **dż**em                 | **j**am               | d͡ʐ] / [ʤ]  |
| h/ch      | **h**ak/**ch**           | lo**ch**              | [x]         |
| j         | pi**j**ę                 | **y**es               | [j]         |
| ł         | ch**ł**opiec             | **w**ill              | [w]         |
| ń         | ko**ń**                  | o**ni**on             | [ɲ]         |
| ś         | cze**ś**ć                | **sh**eep             | [ɕ]         |
| sz        | pro**sz**ę               | **sh**ip              | [ʂ] / [ʃ]   |
| w         | mó**w**i                 | **v**ine              | [v]         |
| ź         | mężczy**ź**ni            | vi**si**on            | [ʑ]         |
| ż/rz      | mę**ż**czyzna/dob**rz**e | trea**s**ure          | [ʐ] / [ʒ]   |

**Note that some sounds are represented by a combination of two letters. This is a purely orthographical matter – they are not “longer” or “double” in any way.**

***ż* and *rz* are used to represent exactly the same sound, the same goes for *h* and *ch*.**

We have omitted some consonants here (*b, d, f, g, k, l, m, n, p, r, s, t, z*). Some of them are pronounced exactly as in English, while in case of the others the difference is rather minor – if you pronounce them like in English, your Polish should still be perfectly understandable.

------

These are very basic and simplified guidelines. There are still other things that you should learn if you want to fully understand why some words are pronounced the way they are, but we will focus on them at a later stage.

If these tables overwhelm you, remember that you will not encounter all of these right away. While making your way through the course, you will probably be able to slowly get accustomed to Polish letters and sounds. Feel free to come back here later if you have any doubts.

#### Vocabulary: Salutations and farewells

***Dzień dobry*** is the greeting used mainly in formal situations. You say *dzień dobry* to greet your teacher, a bank clerk or any person you barely know. Literally, it means *good day*, but is more often translated as *good morning* or *good afternoon*.

**Cześć** is the usual greeting used in informal situations: between friends, co-workers etc. It is roughly equivalent to *hello* or*hi*, but is sometimes also used as a way of saying bye.

***Do widzenia*** is the more formal way of saying goodbye. It is generally used in the same situations where you would use *dzień dobry*, so it is best translated as *goodbye*.

***Pa*** or ***pa pa*** are a lot less formal – roughly the same as *bye* and *bye bye*, they can be considered childish by some.

***Dobranoc*** is reserved for saying goodbye just before you go to bed or generally in the evening – similarly to *goodnight*.

------

#### Vocabulary: po polsku, po angielsku

To say that you speak in some language you use the preposition **po** and a form of the name of the language ending with -u. **polsku** and **angielsku** are in fact old Dative forms and they are not to be found anywhere apart from this one construction. **po polsku** could be understood as *the Polish way*.

# Animals 1

#### Nouns: Gender

All Polish nouns belong to one of three gender categories: **masculine** (*masc.*), **feminine** (*fem.*) and **neuter** (*neut.*)

Grammatical gender is quite significant. Among others, **it determines the case endings that the noun takes**. So, for example, the way in which the Accusative form is created is different for feminine and masculine nouns.

**Grammatical gender is not the same as natural gender** (or sex). Apart from nouns for people and animals (**animate nouns**), it is also assigned to plants, objects and abstract concepts (**inanimate nouns**).

**Grammatical gender is entirely arbitrary and depends mostly on the given word's ending**. There is nothing in the meaning of *woda* (*water*) that would make you think that it is a feminine noun, just as there is nothing particularly masculine about *chleb* (*bread*).

When it comes to animate nouns, the distinction is just as “random”: *kaczka* (*duck*) is of feminine gender, while *pies* (*dog*) is of masculine gender. The gender of the noun is always fixed – even if we are referring to a male duck or a female dog. There exist certain nouns that can be used to describe animals of a specific sex – such as *kaczor* (*male duck*) or *suka* (*female dog*) – but obviously, they are not as common as the general nouns.

------

#### Gender endings

**Masculine nouns usually end in a consonant**, for example: *chłopiec* (*boy*), *kot* (*cat*), *ser* (*cheese*).

However, **some masculine nouns for persons end in -a**, for example: *mężczyzna* (*man*), *kolega* (*colleague*), *artysta* (*artist*).

------

**Feminine nouns tend to end in -a**, for example: *dziewczyna* (*girl*), *ryba* (*fish*), *kawa* (*coffee*).

**There are some exceptions to this rule** – *mysz* (*mouse*) is feminine, even though it ends in a consonant. Other exceptions that are feminine despite not ending with -a include words like *twarz* (*face*), *noc* (*night*) and *miłość* (*love*).

------

**Neuter nouns most often end in -o, -e or -ę**, for example: *dziecko* (*child*), *jedzenie* (*food*), *zwierzę* (*animal*). Another common ending is **-um** (*muzeum* = *museum*), which makes the word neuter and not masculine, despite ending with a consonant.

# Food 1

#### Nouns: The Accusative case

**The Accusative case** (*Acc.*) is usually the case of a noun functioning as the direct object in a sentence.

In other words:

**Nouns in the Accusative follow verbs that require some object to act on. So if a noun is in the Accusative, it usually means that something is being done to it.**

Verbs that are usually used together with the Accusative case include, among others, very basic words such as *mieć* (*to have*) and *lubić* (*to like*).

In this particular skill, the key verbs are ***jeść*** (*to eat*) and ***pić*** (*to drink*) – both of them are used with nouns in the Accusative case.

------

#### The Accusative endings

The Accusative form is created in several ways, depending on the gender of the declined noun.

**For masculine animate nouns, you add the ending -a.**

| Noun (masculine animate) | *I like* + Accusative |
|:------------------------ |:--------------------- |
| kot (*cat*)              | Ja lubię kot**a**.    |
| chłopiec (*boy*)         | Ja lubię chłopc**a**. |
| pies (*dog*)             | Ja lubię ps**a**.     |

Note that apart from adding an ending, declension may involve a change in the root of the noun, as it is in the case of *chłopiec* and *pies*, where the *-ie* segment disappears in all cases other than the Nominative.

------

**For masculine inanimate nouns, there is no change. The Accusative form is exactly the same as the Nominative form.**

| Noun (masculine inanimate) | *I like* + Accusative |
|:-------------------------- |:--------------------- |
| sok (*juice*)              | Ja lubię sok.         |
| chleb (*bread*)            | Ja lubię chleb.       |
| ser (*cheese*)             | Ja lubię ser.         |

------

**The same goes for neuter nouns - no change.**

| Noun (neuter)      | *I like* + Accusative |
|:------------------ |:--------------------- |
| dziecko (*child*)  | Ja lubię dziecko.     |
| zwierzę (*animal*) | Ja lubię zwierzę.     |
| jajko (*egg*)      | Ja lubię jajko.       |

------

**In the case of feminine nouns, you arrive at the Accusative form by changing the final -a into -ę.**

| Noun (feminine)   | *I like* + Accusative |
|:----------------- |:--------------------- |
| kobieta (*woman*) | Ja lubię kobiet**ę**. |
| ryba (*fish*)     | Ja lubię ryb**ę**.    |
| woda (*water*)    | Ja lubię wod**ę**.    |

------

#### Exceptions

There are some exceptions to these rules. In the above examples, we assumed that all nouns that end with *-a* are feminine, but this is not always the case.

Let's consider the most obvious exception: *mężczyzna (man)*. Although the word is of masculine gender, it ends with *-a*. Therefore, it declines as if it was a feminine noun – its Accusative form is *mężczyzn**ę***.

To make things even more interesting, there are also feminine nouns that do not end with *-a* and consequently decline in a different way. But since they are mostly words for abstract concepts, we will discuss them later.

You may notice that the Accusative form of *pomidor (tomato)* is *pomidor**a***, despite not being animate. Some Polish nouns are treated as grammatically animate without any particular logic. The widest group of such nouns is fruits and vegetables. There are Polish speakers who treat them as inanimate, but for fruits and vegetables that is rather rare.

------

#### Vocabulary: obiad and kolacja

*Obiad* is the main meal of the day, usually eaten around midday (12PM to 4PM). It is usually translated as *lunch* (because of the time of the day when it is eaten), sometimes as *dinner* (since it is the main meal which is often eaten socially – with family members, in a restaurant etc.)

*Kolacja* is a medium-sized evening meal, usually eaten between 6PM and 9PM. Again, since the conventions for naming a meal of this kind in English vary, it can be translated in two ways: mainly as *dinner*, but sometimes also as *supper*.

# Defining

#### Nouns: The Instrumental case

**The Instrumental case** (*Instr.*) is used to express the means (or the instrument - hence the name) by which something is done.

**The Instrumental case is essential when defining things**. If you want to describe something by means of a noun, the noun should be in the Instrumental case.

Verbs that are used for defining things include the most fundamental verb – ***być*** (*to be*), for which the following noun phrase is in the Instrumental case.

------

#### Być (to be) – conjugation

| Person                         | być (to be) |
|:------------------------------ |:----------- |
| ja (I)                         | jestem      |
| ty (singular you)              | jesteś      |
| on / ona / ono (he / she / it) | jest        |
| my (we)                        | jesteśmy    |
| wy (plural you)                | jesteście   |
| oni / one (they)               | są          |

------

#### The Instrumental endings

The Instrumental form is created in several ways, depending on the gender of the declined noun.

**For masculine nouns, you add the ending -em (or -iem after *k* and some other consonants).**

| Noun (masculine)   | *He is* + Instrumental   |
|:------------------ |:------------------------ |
| chłopiec (*boy*)   | On jest chłopc**em**.    |
| człowiek (*human*) | On jest człowiek**iem**. |
| pies (*dog*)       | On jest ps**em**.        |

Note that apart from adding an ending, declension may involve a change in the root of the noun, as it is in the case of *chłopiec* and *pies*, where the *-ie* segment disappears in all cases other than the Nominative.

------

**In the case of feminine nouns, you arrive at the Instrumental form by changing the final -a into -ą.**

| Noun (feminine)      | *She is* + Instrumental   |
|:-------------------- |:------------------------- |
| kobieta (*woman*)    | Ona jest kobiet**ą**.     |
| dziewczynka (*girl*) | Ona jest dziewczynk**ą**. |
| ryba (*fish*)        | Ona jest ryb**ą**.        |

------

**When it comes to neuter nouns, you have to delete the final -o and replace it with -em (or -iem after *k* and some other consonants).**

| Noun (neuter)      | *It is* + Instrumental   |
|:------------------ |:------------------------ |
| dziecko (*child*)  | Ono jest dzieck**iem**.  |
| zwierzę (*animal*) | Ono jest zwierzęc**iem** |
| lustro (*mirror*)  | Ono jest lustr**em**.    |

Note that *zwierzę* is an exception – an additional consonant appears before the ending.

------

#### Defining: to + Nominative

**Another way of defining things is using *to* + a noun in the Nominative.** This method is quite common, and definitely easier to use for learners.

There is, however, one crucial difference: **you usually cannot use this construction with pronouns**. Sentences such as *On to chłopiec* or *Ona to dziewczynka* sound rather sloppy.

Using it with nouns is easy – all of them are in the Nominative form:

- *Tygrys **to** kot.* (*The tiger is a cat*)
- *Pies **to** zwierzę.* (*The dog is an animal*)
- *Zupa **to** jedzenie.* (*Soup is food*)

------

#### Asking questions

Unlike English, Polish does not have verbs that would be used as auxiliary verbs when asking questions such as: **Are** you a boy? *or **Do** you eat meat?*

However, there is a word which you can use to start questions: the interrogative particle ***czy***.

Forming questions with *czy* is rather easy: just place it at the beginning of the sentence. The word order remains the same, you just use rising intonation to mark that it is a question.

- *On jest chłopcem.* -> *Czy on jest chłopcem?* (*He is a boy.* -> *Is he a boy?*)
- *Pies pije wodę.* -> *Czy pies pije wodę?* (*The dog is drinking water.* -> *Is the dog drinking water?*)

If you see *czy* at the beginning of the sentence, you can be sure that it is a real yes/no question.

But questions can also be formed in another, even more simple way: by simply adding a question mark at the end of the sentence (or using rising intonation). No need to change the word order.

- *Ona ma dziecko.* -> *Ona ma dziecko?*

(*She has a child.* -> *Does she have a child?* / *She has a child?*)

- *On lubi mleko.* -> *On lubi mleko?*

(*He likes milk.* -> *Does he like milk?* / *He likes milk?*)

As you can see, those can also be understood as expressing surprise ("What?! She has a child?!"), not necessarily being a real question. So while it is by no means mandatory, questions with *czy* are usually more emphatic than those without it.

Don't be surprised if you come across the word *czy* later in the course, when it's used mid-sentence. It can have two more meanings:

\1) A so-called 'exclusive or' in questions (which means that you offer two or more possibilities, only one of which is true):

- To mężczyzna **czy** kobieta? (Is that a man **or** a woman?)

\2) A conjunction. The rule here is that whenever you can put 'whether' in English, you must use 'czy':

- Nie wiem, **czy** to prawda. (I don't know **whether/if** this is true.)

------

*Some of the sentences used in this skill (and in the examples here) may seem a bit far-fetched. However, what matters the most is their purpose – teaching you the basic grammar rules while practicing basic vocabulary.*

# Demonstrative pronouns

#### Demonstrative determiners

**Demonstrative determiners are used to point at things.**

When talking about something that is immediate or nearby, you use *ten* (and its forms):

- *Jem **ten** chleb* (*I am eating **this** bread*)
- *Lubię **tę** dziewczynkę* (*I like **this** girl*)

You know that Polish has no articles, but in many cases English "the" means virtually the same as "this" or "these". Therefore forms of *ten* can potentially be translated also as "the", although it's a bit more of an interpretation than a translation.

------

When referring to something that is more distant, you use *tamten* (and its forms):

- *Jem **tamten** chleb* (*I am eating **that** bread*)
- *Lubię **tamtą** dziewczynkę* (*I like **that** girl*)

In some cases it can also be translated as *the other one* or *the other*.

------

Pronouns share many properties with nouns. Just like nouns, **they take different forms depending on the gender and case of the noun they accompany (or replace: this one, that one)**.

**The table below shows the forms of the pronoun *ten* (*this*):**

| demonstr. pronoun in singular (*this*) | masculine                            | feminine | neuter |
|:-------------------------------------- |:------------------------------------ |:-------- |:------ |
| **Nominative**                         | ten                                  | ta       | to     |
| **Accusative**                         | ten (*inanimate*) / tego (*animate*) | t**ę**   | to     |
| **Instrumental**                       | tym                                  | tą       | tym    |

------

**Here are the forms of the pronoun *tamten* (*that*):**

| demonstr. pronoun in singular (*that*) | masculine                                  | feminine  | neuter |
|:-------------------------------------- |:------------------------------------------ |:--------- |:------ |
| **Nominative**                         | tamten                                     | tamta     | tamto  |
| **Accusative**                         | tamten (*inanimate*) / tamtego (*animate*) | tamt**ą** | tamto  |
| **Instrumental**                       | tamtym                                     | tamtą     | tamtym |

Apart from the difference between **tę** and **tamtą**, all other corresponding forms, both in the cases you already know and those that you don't, differ only by the prefix **tam-** used in the that/those determiners.

------

#### The dummy pronoun "to"

The dummy pronoun "to" (which is identical to the neuter singular form of "this") is used as the subject of a sentence. It doesn't change regardless of the gender nor the grammatical number, it always stays as "to". Therefore it can be a translation of all the following words: **this, that, it, these, those**.

In a sentence like **"This duck eats", "this" is a determiner.** Because it describes a noun, its Polish equivalent has to match this noun: **"Ta kaczka je"**. In a sentence like **"This is a duck", "this" is the subject**, and it could potentially also be "that" or "it". **"[This/That/It] is a duck" are exactly the same from the point of view of Polish and they all translate to "To jest kaczka".**

You haven’t encountered all those words yet, but you will soon, at it is worth showing that “to” is the subject for any gender.

| English                      | Polish                    | English              | Polish                 |
|:---------------------------- |:------------------------- |:-------------------- |:---------------------- |
| **This boy** eats.           | **Ten chłopiec** je.      | **This is** a boy.   | **To jest** chłopiec.  |
| **That duck** drinks.        | **Tamta kaczka** pije.    | **That is** a duck.  | **To jest** kaczka.    |
| **This child** has an apple. | **To dziecko** ma jabłko. | **It is** a child.   | **To jest** dziecko.   |
| **These boys** are…          | **Ci chłopcy** są…        | **These are** boys.  | **To są** chłopcy.     |
| **Those girls** are…         | **Tamte dziewczynki** są… | **Those are** girls. | **To są** dziewczynki. |

In the sentences from the last column, you could potentially even omit “jest”/”są”, but that works mostly as a short answer to some question. (- Co to jest? - To kaczka. = - What is it? - It’s a duck.)

------

#### Notions of closeness

Although **tamten** and its forms are the direct equivalent of **that**, the Polish determiner is used a lot less often than its English equivalent. Basically, Polish and English think differently about the 'closeness' of objects. Simplifying, we can show it by using the following table:

| this | that | that (that one over there) |
|:---- |:---- |:-------------------------- |
| ten  | ten  | tamten                     |

We can see that **tamten** and its forms are really used only for objects that are quite far from the speaker. The basic translations in this course are always direct (this -> ten, that -> tamten), but the accepted answers are as in the table. Therefore any form of "tamten" can only be translated as "that", but any form of "ten" can be translated (without context) as [this/that/the]. This also means that the word "that" can not only be translated as "tamten", but also "ten" (and their forms).

# Adjectives 1

#### Adjectives: Gender

Polish adjectives appear before the noun they modify. There are few exceptions to this (they are mostly categorizing, things like names of animal species etc.)

Just like nouns, adjectives have different gender forms. **The gender of an adjective depends on the noun it describes**.

So if you want to use the adjective *mały* (*little*) to describe the feminine noun *girl* (*dziewczynka*), you have to use the feminine form of the adjective – *mał**a*** – to form the phrase *mała dziewczynka*.

The table below contains the singular gender forms of some simple adjectives:

| Adjective       | masculine  | feminine   | neuter      |
|:--------------- |:---------- |:---------- |:----------- |
| mały (*small*)  | mał**y**   | mał**a**   | mał**e**    |
| dobry (*good*)  | dobr**y**  | dobr**a**  | dobr**e**   |
| stary (*old*)   | star**y**  | star**a**  | star**e**   |
| wielki (*huge*) | wielk**i** | wielk**a** | wielk**ie** |

Luckily, there is a clear pattern there. Most masculine adjectives take the **-y** ending (some take **-i**). Feminine adjectives take the **-a** ending. Finally, the neuter ending is **-e** (sometimes **-ie**).

Learning the adjective endings can sometimes help you take advantage of their regularity. For example, if you forget the gender of the noun *mysz*, but then see it together with an adjective ending with **-a**, you can safely assume that the noun is feminine.

------

#### Adjectives: Case

This would be suspiciously easy, if it was not for another feature adjectives share with nouns: case. Once again, **the case of an adjective agrees with the noun that follows it**.

The table above has taught you the adjective endings in the most basic case – the Nominative. Now, let's examine the other two cases that you have already encountered when learning about nouns: the Accusative and the Instrumental.

*Note that not all of the forms below are used in this skill – some are going to appear a bit later. This is to allow you to focus on learning the general rules, instead of cramming too many individual forms.*

------

#### Adjectives: Accusative

| Adjective       | masculine + Accusative     | feminine + Accusative | neuter + Accusative |
|:--------------- |:-------------------------- |:--------------------- |:------------------- |
| mały (*small*)  | mał**y** / mał**ego**      | mał**ą**              | mał**e**            |
| dobry (*good*)  | dobr**y** / dobr**ego**    | dobr**ą**             | dobr**e**           |
| stary (*old*)   | star**y** / star**ego**    | star**ą**             | star**e**           |
| wielki (*huge*) | wielk**i** / wielk**iego** | wielk**ą**            | wielk**ie**         |

Seems a bit complicated. To make things clearer, let's take a look at some examples:

- *Piję dobr**e** wino* (*I am drinking good wine*)

*Wino* is a neuter noun. In this sentence it is the object of *piję*, so it appears in the Accusative form. Therefore, the adjective *dobry* assumes the Accusative neuter form – *dobr**e***.

- *Piję dobr**ą** herbatę* (*I am drinking good tea*)

The situation is pretty much the same, but the noun is feminine, so we need the feminine Accusative form – *dobr**ą***.

------

Masculine adjectives have two forms – the first one (**-y** or **-i**) is used to modify inanimate masculine nouns and therefore is identical to Nominative, just like them. The other one (**-ego**) goes with animate masculine nouns.

------

#### Adjectives: Instrumental

| Adjective       | masculine + Instrumental | feminine + Instrumental | neuter + Instrumental |
|:--------------- |:------------------------ |:----------------------- |:--------------------- |
| mały (*small*)  | mał**ym**                | mał**ą**                | mał**ym**             |
| dobry (*good*)  | dobr**ym**               | dobr**ą**               | dobr**ym**            |
| stary (*old*)   | star**ym**               | star**ą**               | star**ym**            |
| wielki (*huge*) | wielk**im**              | wielk**ą**              | wielk**im**           |

Again, let's consider some examples:

- *Jestem mał**ym** chłopcem* (*I am a little boy*)

*Chłopiec* is a masculine noun. Here it is the object of *jestem*, so it takes the Instrumental form. Therefore, the adjective *mały* assumes the Instrumental masculine form – *mał**ym***.

- *Jestem mał**ą** dziewczynką* (*I am a small girl*)

Just as above, but this time the noun is feminine, so we need the feminine Instrumental form – *mał**ą***.

# Plurals

The most important thing you have to know about Polish plurals is that they **DO NOT** divide into masculine, feminine and neuter ones. The Polish plurals are:

- **masculine personal / virile** (used for ‘groups with at least one male person’)
- **not masculine-personal / nonvirile** (used for everything else)

Their names may be complicated, but at least they are descriptive. So, let’s check if we all are on the same page:

- **mężczyźni** (men) belong to the **‘masculine personal’** plural, as this noun describes a male-only group.
- **ludzie** (people) also belong to the **‘masculine personal’** plural, as this noun describes a group with at least one male person – otherwise we would use a word for “women” or “girls”.
- **kobiety** (women) belong to the **‘not masculine-personal’** plural, as logically, there are no men here.
- **koty** (cats) also belong to the **‘not masculine-personal’** plural, as they are not *persons*. It doesn’t matter that the singular word *kot* (cat) is masculine, it doesn’t denote a person.
- **dzieci** (children) are **‘not masculine-personal’** plural as well, because the singular word *dziecko* (child) is neuter. Even if the particular children you are talking about are all boys, if you decided to call them “children” and not “boys”, then we are still talking about ‘not masculine-personal’ plural.

This distinction is also a reason for which *oni* will be used even if there is one man and 99 women in the group, and *one* will only be used for an all-female group.

Please note that only some part of the following sections will be used in this skill, but it is good to put it all in one place.

------

#### Nouns: Nominative plural

There are many possible endings in Nominative plural, this table shows the most common ones.

| English     | Nominative sg | Nominative pl |
|:----------- |:------------- |:------------- |
| horse(s)    | ko**ń**       | ko**nie**     |
| boy(s)      | chłop**iec**  | chłop**cy**   |
| men/men     | mężczy**zna** | mężczy**źni** |
| cucumber(s) | ogór**ek**    | ogór**ki**    |
| duck(s)     | kacz**ka**    | kacz**ki**    |
| apple(s)    | jabłk**o**    | jabłk**a**    |

------

#### Nouns: Accusative plural

You may remember that **masculine inanimate** and **neuter** nouns in singular had the Accusative form identical to the Nominative one. Luckily, the same goes for all the **‘not masculine-personal’ plural** nouns, those forms are also identical.

A different form is needed for the **’masculine personal’ plural** nouns. The most common ending is **-ów** (Widzę chłopców = I see boys).

------

#### Nouns: Instrumental plural

The majority of nouns, regardless of their gender, have **-ami** ending in Instrumental.

------

#### Adjectives: Nominative plural

As mentioned before, the distinction between two plurals is important for adjectives. You already learned adjectives in Nominative for all three singular genders, now we will add the two plural genders. In Nominative, the ‘not masculine-personal’ plural adjective is identical to the neuter singular one. The ‘masculine personal’ one, on the other hand, is quite different from the other forms. It is kinda softened. Compare: **dobre** and **dobrzy**, **złe** and **źli**, **małe** and **mali**.

| Adjective     | ‘Masculine personal’ Nominative | ‘Not masculine-personal’ Nominative |
|:------------- |:------------------------------- |:----------------------------------- |
| mały (small)  | ma**li**                        | ma**łe**                            |
| dobry (good)  | dob**rzy**                      | dob**re**                           |
| stary (old)   | sta**rzy**                      | sta**re**                           |
| zły (bad)     | **źli**                         | **złe**                             |
| wielki (huge) | wiel**cy**                      | wiel**kie**                         |

Compare between **mężczyźni** (men) and **kobiety** (women): **dobrzy/źli/wielcy** mężczyźni; **dobre/złe/wielkie** kobiety.

------

#### Adjectives: Accusative plural

Just like with nouns, in Accusative the ‘not masculine-personal’ plural form of the adjective is identical to the Nominative form, so you only have to remember the ‘masculine personal’ ending which is **-ich** or **-ych**.

| Adjective     | ‘Masculine personal’ Accusative | ‘Not masculine-personal’ Accusative |
|:------------- |:------------------------------- |:----------------------------------- |
| mały (small)  | małych                          | małe                                |
| dobry (good)  | dobrych                         | dobre                               |
| stary (old)   | starych                         | stare                               |
| zły (bad)     | złych                           | złe                                 |
| wielki (huge) | wielkich                        | wielkie                             |

Compare:

- Widzę **dobrych/złych/wielkich** mężczyzn.
- Widzę **dobre/złe/wielkie** kobiety.

------

#### Adjectives: Instrumental plural

This is where everything becomes easy: both plurals have the same ending, which is **-mi**.

Compare:

- Oni są **dobrymi/złymi/wielkimi** mężczyznami.
- One są **dobrymi/złymi/wielkimi** kobietami.

------

#### Demonstratives: plural

Last but not least, it’s time to introduce the plural demonstratives. Just like with adjectives, the ‘masculine personal’ plural form is kinda softened and it’s **(tam)ci**. The ‘not masculine-personal’ plural form is **(tam)te**. The only cases in which the plural demonstratives differ are Nominative and Accusative, in all the other cases they are identical for both plurals.

| Determiner (these/those) | Nominative | Accusative   | Instrumental |
|:------------------------ |:---------- |:------------ |:------------ |
| Masculine personal       | ci/tamci   | tych/tamtych | tymi/tamtymi |
| Not masculine-personal   | te/tamte   | te/tamte     | tymi/tamtymi |

# Clothing

This is a problematic skill, because an important construction has been forgotten during the process of creating this course and cannot be added to an already released tree.

So far all the Polish verbs you learned were correct translation of both Present Simple and Present Continuous. In this skill you learn the first verb that **does not** work like that.

The verb **nosić** taught in this skill does mean "to wear" (or "to carry"), **BUT NOT** "to be wearing".

"to be wearing" in Polish translates to "mieć na sobie" (literally "to have on oneself") and is unfortunately not taught in this course. This is one of the rare examples where the Polish verb does not have both the meaning of Present Simple and Present Continuous.

------

#### Vocabulary and Grammar

Both **nosić** and the not-taught **mieć na sobie** take an object in Accusative.

**bluza** is an umbrella term for a sweatshirt/jumper/hoodie/etc., **BUT NOT** a blouse. It's a false friend, "blouse" translates into "bluzka". Almost the same, but very different.

**kapelusz** has a brim. It can be an elegant top hat or a straw hat for farmers, but it **IS NOT** a baseball cap nor a winter beanie.

A cap (or a winter beanie) translates to **czapka**. Many native speakers of English would however also use the word "hat" for a "czapka", which makes the translations confusing.

# Verbs: Present 1

You have already learned several verbs, now it is time for a separate skill only for verbs. Apart from the remaining forms of **mówić** (to speak) in Lesson 1, every other lesson introduces all forms of a completely new verb. All those verbs take an object in **Accusative**.

This is a good moment to remind that Accusative of masculine nouns depends on whether the noun is animate or inanimate. If the noun is **masculine inanimate, the Accusative form is identical to the Nominative one**, and if it’s **masculine animate, then Accusative is identical to Genitive**. Which you don’t know yet, but you will learn in the next skill, so it’s worth knowing already.

------

Most Polish verbs have relatively regular conjugation, with two most common patterns, which will be shown on the following examples from the skill:

| Grammatical person              | (pronoun) + conjugated form of “widzieć” (to see) |
|:------------------------------- |:------------------------------------------------- |
| 1st person singular (I)         | (ja) widz**ę**                                    |
| 2nd person singular (you)       | (ty) widz**isz**                                  |
| 3rd person singular (he/she/it) | (on/ona/ono) widz**i**                            |
| 1st person plural (we)          | (my) widz**imy**                                  |
| 2nd person plural (you)         | (wy) widz**icie**                                 |
| 3rd person plural (they)        | (oni/one) widz**ą**                               |

| Grammatical person              | (pronoun) + conjugated form of “kochać” (to love) |
|:------------------------------- |:------------------------------------------------- |
| 1st person singular (I)         | (ja) koch**am**                                   |
| 2nd person singular (you)       | (ty) koch**asz**                                  |
| 3rd person singular (he/she/it) | (on/ona/ono) koch**a**                            |
| 1st person plural (we)          | (my) koch**amy**                                  |
| 2nd person plural (you)         | (wy) koch**acie**                                 |
| 3rd person plural (they)        | (oni/one) koch**ają**                             |

------

#### Vocabulary: kochać vs lubić

This is mostly for speakers of Russian, who tend to mix them up. **kochać** and **lubić** are very different in Polish, “kochać” being a lot stronger – it is either romantic love or love between members of family. Please keep to the direct translation of **“kochać” = “to love” and “lubić” = “to like”**.

Some native speakers of Polish do not like the idea of using “kochać” with inanimate objects, but it is possible and used in this course. A better verb for ‘loving’ inanimate objects may be **uwielbiać**, which with people is something between "to love" and "to adore".

------

#### Vocabulary: znać vs wiedzieć

You don’t have “wiedzieć” introduced yet, but it is worth to be aware of it, as the difference between them is often problematic for the learners. **znać** is more like **“to be familiar with something/someone”**, while **wiedzieć** is **“to have some knowledge”**. Generally, “znać” will be translated as “to know X” and “wiedzieć” will be “to know about X”, “to know, that X”, and similar. They are absolutely **not** interchangeable and almost always when one is correct, the other will be completely wrong.

------

#### Grammar: Infinitives

As you see, the Tips & Notes use the infinitive forms of the verb (the basic ones, those that you will find in a dictionary), although none of them has been introduced in the course yet. Time will come for that, we are still in the very basics.

------

#### Grammar: Perfective vs imperfective

Another point for which it is too early, but it is good to know that already: Polish verbs are either **perfective** or **imperfective**. The Polish names (dokonany and niedokonany) may be literally translated as ‘accomplished’ and ‘not-accomplished’, which show their functions well.

**Perfective verbs focus on the effect of finishing the action. Imperfective verbs focus on the process, on the duration.** Because of that, by definition, **all verbs in the Present Tense are imperfective**. It is impossible to use a perfective verb in the Present Tense. They will be introduced later in the tree.
