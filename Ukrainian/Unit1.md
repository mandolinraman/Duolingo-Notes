## About typing Ukrainian

We have seen many reports about the Ukrainian alphabet. Please read [this post](https://duolinguists.wordpress.com/switching-between-latin-and-cyrillic/) about typing in Ukrainian

A note about spelling Ukrainian words:

## do not write in both Latin and Cyrillic, use either one or the other

e.g. Write "tse mama" or "це мама" - not "цe мaмa". Note how the vowels look different, the Latin "e" and the Cyrillic "е" are unfortunately NOT interchangeable.

## Welcome!

Please make sure you read the following posts ***before*** you start the course:

- [Before you set about conquering the DL Ukrainian tree](https://duolinguists.wordpress.com/before-you-set-about-conquering-the-dl-ukrainian-tree/)
- [A quick introduction to Ukrainian](https://youtu.be/o76SHvlLS5I)

We would like to welcome you to the Ukrainian for English speakers course. It is the official language of Ukraine but is also spoken in parts of Russia, Poland, Romania, The Czech Republic, Canada and many other countries! Despite what you may think, Ukrainian doesn't sound as Slavic as Polish or Russian, but more like Italian or Latin.

The Ukrainian language is written using a variant of the Cyrillic alphabet (just like Russian, Serbian, Bulgarian, etc.). In this skill you will learn 13 of the 33 letters. We will not present letters separately, but rather in simple words that contain them. Here you will learn the words that have the following letters:

| Ukrainian Letter | English Equivalent         | IPA   |
|:---------------- |:-------------------------- |:----- |
| **М м**          | **m**an                    | [m]   |
| **А а**          | **awe**some                | [ɑ]   |
| **Т т**          | **t**able*                 | [t]   |
| **О о**          | b**a**ll                   | [ɔ]   |
| **І і**          | s**ee**                    | [i]   |
| **К к**          | **k**ey*                   | [k]   |
| **Д д**          | **d**ot*                   | [d̪]  |
| **Е е**          | t**e**n                    | [ɛ]   |
| **Х х**          | lo**ch**                   | [ɦ]   |
| **Ц ц**          | ca**ts***                  | [t͡s] |
| **Я я**          | **ya**rd                   | [jɑ]  |
| **Н н**          | **n**ose                   | n]    |
| **И и**          | like in h**i**t but longer | [ɪ]   |

*Note that sounds with asterisk aren't pronounced with a puff of air like in English.

There are no articles *a/an, the* in the Ukrainian language. The meaning of English articles is usually conveyed by the context. But sometimes words like *this and that* are used when translating. So for example; the word **дім** can mean "**house**", "**a house**" and "**the house**" depending on the context.

Although there are Present, Past and Future forms of Ukrainian verb *to be* - **бути**, it is rarely used in Present tense. English words *is, am, are* don't have Ukrainian counterparts. Thus, the English four-word sentence *I am a student* is just two words in Ukrainian: **Я студент**. In writing, when a sentence equates two nouns in a row, a long dash is written between the nouns to indicate the verb *to be*. For example, *My sister is a student* translates to **Моя сестра — студентка**.

## Which form of and do I use?

In Ukrainian, there are four words that mean *and*; і, та, а and й. Three of them; і, та and й are all used to link similar things, the only reason we have so many is so we can switch them around to make the language flow and sound more melodic.

- Мама і тато - Mom and dad
- Та я! - And me!
- Мова й алфавіт - Language and alphabet

Strictly speaking, there are certain rules when to use which, but we do not impose them in this course to make it easier for beginners. Therefore, it is really up to you when to use which. :)

But on the other hand, **а** is used to contrast between two *different* things. It is kind of in the middle between "and" and "but" and most of the times it can be translated as either "and" or "but".

- Мама там, а тато тут - Mom is there, *and/whereas* dad is here
- Я працюю а ти танцюєш - I work *and/whereas* you work
- Мене звати Віктор а вас звати Віра - My name is Victor *and/whereas* your name is Vira

| **ь**            | No sound, it's a soft sign that softens the previous consonant. Read more [here](https://duolinguists.wordpress.com/ukrainian-alphabet-uk-grammar-portal/) | -     |

*Note that sounds with asterisk aren't pronounced with a puff of air like in English.

##### YOU IN UKRAINIAN

**Ви** is a plural or singular formal *you*. It can be used to address to a group of people or to one person in a formal setting (like talking to a boss, an older person

**Ти** is a singular informal *you*, which can be used with friends, relatives, children.

You can read more on that [here](https://duolinguists.wordpress.com/personal-pronouns-in-ukrainian-uk-grammar-portal/)

##### ABOUT GENDER AND NUMBER OF NOUNS

Ukrainian nouns have gender (masculine, feminine, neuter) and number. Gender is fairly easy to define.

| Gender    | Ending    | Example                |
|:--------- |:--------- |:---------------------- |
| Masculine | consonant | **друг** *male friend* |
| Feminine  | **-а,-я** | **школа** *school*     |
| Neuter    | **-о,-е** | **місто** *city*       |

A trick to remember: "ah ya oh eh" sounds like "Hiya Owen"!

Nouns **тато** (*dad*) and **дядько** (*uncle*) don’t have a consonant ending, but for an obvious reason are considered masculine.

In plural form masculine and feminine nouns have ending **и** or **і**: **маши́ни** (*cars*); **брати́** (*brothers*); **студе́нти** (*students*).

##### ABOUT PRONOUN-NOUN AGREEMENT

Pronouns that describe nouns also have gender and number and agree with nouns in form.

| Masc.                           | Fem.                              | Neuter                       | Plural                          |
|:------------------------------- |:--------------------------------- |:---------------------------- |:------------------------------- |
| **Чий бра́т?** (whose brother?) | **Чия́ сестра́?** (whose sister?) | **Чиє місто?** (whose city?) | **Чиї батьки?**(whose parents?) |
| **Мій брат** (my brother)       | **Моя сестра** (my sister)        | **Моє місто** (my city)      | **Мої батьки** (my parents)     |

# Letter 3

| **П п**          | **p**ool                                                                                         | [p]  |
| **Р р**          | A thrilled "r" like Spanish/Italian, read more [here](http://www.wikihow.com/Roll-Your-%22R%22s) | [r]  |
| **Є є**          | **ye**s                                                                                          | [jɛ] |
| **Ш ш**          | **sh**op                                                                                         | [ʃ]  |
| **Щ щ**          | **st**reet (read more below)                                                                     | [k]  |
| **Г г**          | **h**ill                                                                                         | [ɦ]  |
| **З з**          | **z**oo                                                                                          | [z]  |
| **Ж ж**          | trea**s**ure                                                                                     | [ʒ]  |
| **Ф ф**          | **f**ox                                                                                          | [f]  |

### Pronunciation of щ

The sound that щ makes can be difficult for learners to learn but believe it or not, we use this sound in English a lot! Say the following words:

- Street
- Straight
- Stride

Note that the first three letters are pronounced sh-ch-r. If we remove the "r" sound we get the same sound as щ! Now say the same words without the "r" sound.

- St(r)eet
- St(r)aight
- St(r)ide

**However...**

In Modern Ukrainian, many people also pronounce it like a "sh" sound. But not just *any* sh sound. Here is a guide on the more casual pronunciation:

1. Say "car" in a general American accent

2. Stop! Keep your tongue in that final "r" position!

3. Now make a "sh" sound with your mouth in that position.

Note that this is different to the "sh" in "ship" (which is the sound ш makes)

### A quick note on verbs

Ukrainian verbs, just like verbs in many other languages, have conjugations, that is, depending on a personal pronoun a verb takes a different ending. For example: **я їм** (I eat), **ви їсте́** (you eat); **я люблю́** (I like), **ви любите** (you like).

Ukrainian verb infinitives (initial forms of verbs you find in dictionaries) always have ending **–ти**. For example: **пити** (to drink); **я люблю пити сік** (I like to drink juice).

### Ukraine-specific vocabulary

One word in this section might be confusing for foreigners if they are not familiar with it. Here is a picture to demonstrate:

**Борщ (borshch)** - a Ukrainian soup

## Having a conversation in Ukrainian

Like English, Ukrainian has more than one way of greeting people:

- Приві́т - Hi (for friends, family, children)
- До́брий ра́нок - Good morning
- До́брий день - Good afternoon/day (a general way to say hello)
- До́брий ве́чір - Good evening
- До поба́чення - Goodbye

There are of course other phrases but you will learn them as time goes on. These are standard phrases everyone should know.

**Saying your name**

In Ukrainian there are two forms for saying/asking for names. They are 100% interchangeable!

- If someone asks "Як вас зва́ти?" (lit. *how to call you?*), say "Мене́ зва́ти..." (lit. *to call me...*)

- If someone asks "Як вас звуть?" (lit. *how do (they) call you*), say "Мене́ звуть..." (lit. *(they) call me*).

**Asking how you are**

In Ukrainian, there are two ways to ask someone how they are, but each one has a slightly different meaning.

"Як справи?" (lit. *how (are) things*) is used to ask how someone is doing. They might reply with a lengthy answer such as "*I'm fine, thanks for asking, I went to the village yesterday and you'll never guess who I saw...". A good alternate translation would be "Any news?/How are you doing?"

"Як ти/ви?" (lit. *how (are) you*) is used to ask how someone is **feeling**. Similar to the English "How are you holding up?"

---

**Note on Ukrainian Culture - Smiling and feeling"**

In Ukraine, asking how someone is, does not work as simple as in English:

- "Hey, how are you?"
- "I'm great thanks, and you?"
- "I'm great too"

In Ukraine, asking how someone is, is seen as a kind and lovely question to ask. You don't simply pass a stranger and ask it. People will often reply with long and **honest** answers about their life and how they are feeling for example "*I'm not so good today because...*". Also, not listening to what they have to say after asking the question is seen as quite rude.

You may notice that Ukrainians (and Eastern Europeans in general) smile less than most other Europeans and especially Americans! This is not because they are sad but rather it is seen as a bit odd to smile while doing your shopping, walking down the street and other everyday activities. Of course, Ukrainians *do* smile but just not as often as most people :)

### About Grammatical Gender

In Ukrainian, all nouns have a gender (just like Spanish, German, Russian, French). In Ukrainian, there are **three grammatical genders**; masculine, feminine and neuter. Essentially, everything in Ukrainian (including non-living things such as chairs, socks and cities) are all a he, she or an it. Unlike some languages, guessing what gender a noun is easy, just learn these rules and you'll know 90% of Ukrainian noun's genders.

- Masculine nouns end in a consonant, for example: бра**т**, дру**г**, ді**м**, ме**д**, **кінь**, паву**к** are .all masculine.

- Feminine nouns usually end in **-а** or **-я**, for example: вод**а** and свин**я** are feminine.

- Neuter nouns usually end in **-о**, **-е** or a double consonant followed by **-я** for example: молок**о**, по**ле** and жи**ття** are neuter.

Now, like any language Ukrainian obviously has exceptions. Words relating to men are *usually masculine* (тато, дядько) nouns ending in **-ь** can be any gender but the majority are feminine and the exception to the consonant rule is **суддя**.

#### Gender - Summary

To learn the endings quickly, we use a trick called *Hiya Owen*.

- Masculine nouns ends in a consonant (simple, right?)

- Feminine nouns end in -а -я (ah ya sounds like hiya)

- Neuter nouns end in -о -е (oh eh sounds like Owen)

All together, the endings sounds like *Hiya Owen*! The only other rule you need to remember is that nouns ending in *double-consonant+я* are neuter e.g. жи***ття**

You can read more about gender of Ukrainian nouns [**here**](http://www.ukrainianlanguage.org.uk/read/unit05/page5-3.htm) and [**here**](http://ukrainiangrammar.com/article/2011-01-22/the-noun-gender.html).

## About plural of nouns

In this lesson you will learn a couple of new nouns in plural form. They follow the same rule as all Ukrainian nouns. Ukrainian by nature isn't a very irregular language, so by learning this rule you'll be an Ukrainian-plural expert in no time!

Here are the basic rules, you can find more information [here](http://ukrainianlanguage.org.uk/read/unit05/page5-4.htm) and [here](http://ukrainianlanguage.org.uk/read/unit06/page6-3.htm)

#### Feminine

- If it ends in -а take the ending -и

- If it ends in -я take the ending -і (not ї, that's a common mistake :P)

- If it ends in -жа, -ча, -ша or -ща, replace the -а with -і.

| Hard                | Soft                | Mixed                 |
|:------------------- |:------------------- |:--------------------- |
| Мам**а** - Мам**и** | Дин**я** - Дин**і** | Груш**а** - Груш**і** |

[Learn more here](http://ukrainianlanguage.org.uk/read/unit06/page6-4.htm)

#### Masculine

- Most nouns take the ending -и

- Nouns ending in -ь and take the ending -і (note many words lose its -е-)

- Many ending in -р take the ending -і also

- Nouns ending in -й take the ending -ї

- If it ends in -ж, -ч, -ш or -щ, add an -і.

- If it ends in -ж, -ч, -ш or -щ add an -і.

| Hard             | Soft                   | Mixed                  |
|:---------------- |:---------------------- |:---------------------- |
| Брат - Брат**и** | День - Дн**і**         | Чита**ч** - Читач**і** |
|                  | Ліка**р** - Лікар**і** |                        |
|                  | Воді**й** - Воді**ї**  |                        |

[Learn more](http://ukrainianlanguage.org.uk/read/unit06/page6-5.htm)

#### Neuter Nouns

- If it ends in -о take the ending -а

- If it ends in -е take the ending -я

- If it ends in -же, -че, -ше or -ще, replace the -е with -а.

| Hard                  | Soft                | Mixed                       |
|:--------------------- |:------------------- |:--------------------------- |
| Міст**о** - Міст**а** | Мор**е** - Мор**я** | Прізвищ**е** - Прізвищ**а** |

## About To Have In Ukrainian

Like saying your name, to have is not translated word for word in Ukrainian. Even though *there is* a verb to have in Ukrainian it requires a thing called case, something that you haven't learned yet. There is a brief description of the verb at the bottom but it's best to use the first form when beginning. There is pretty difference and both forms are correct in *99.9% of situations*.

### У себе бути - First Form

This form literally translates into "*At one to be*". To put it into the present tense just change the **себе** to one of the words used when saying your name and change the **бути** to **є** in the present tense. So "*I have*" would be "**У мене є**, literally meaning "*To me there is*". Let's take some examples.

- У мене є сестра - I have a sister (lit. *To me there is (a) sister*)
- У тебе є брат - You have a brother (lit. *To you there is (a) a brother*)
- У вас є мати - You have a mother (lit. *To you there is mother*)

Here is the full verb in the present tense.

| Ukrainian | English                          | Transliteration |
|:--------- |:-------------------------------- |:--------------- |
| У мене є  | I have                           | U mene ye       |
| У тебе є  | You have (singular and informal) | U tebe ye       |
| У нього є | He/It has                        | U nyoho ye      |
| У неї є   | She has                          | U neyi ye       |
| У нас є   | We have                          | U nas ye        |
| У вас є   | You have (plural and formal)     | U vas ye        |
| У них є   | They have                        | U nykh ye       |

### Мати - Second Form

This form works just like a normal verb but there's a twist you have to change the following words ending! This is quite complicated if you are just starting and you don't need to learn it until a later skill. But if you do want to learn it; Read [this post](https://duolinguists.wordpress.com/the-accusative-case-uk-grammar-portal/) on the grammar portal and check out the table below.

| Ukrainian  | English                         | Transliteration |

| Ти маєш    | You have (singular and informal | Ty mayesh       |
| Він має    | He has                          | Vin maye        |
| Вона має   | She has                         | Vona maye       |
| Воно має   | It has                          | Vono maye       |
| Ми маємо   | We have                         | My mayemo       |
| Ви маєте   | You have (plural and formal     | Vy mayut'       |

# Numbers 1

##### About gender of numerals

Ukrainian cardinal numerals “один” (one) and “два” (two) have gender forms:

один брат - *one brother* (masculine); одн**а** сестра - *one sister* (feminine); одн**е** місто - *one city* (neuter)

два брати - *two brothers* (masculine); дв**і** сестри - *two sisters* (feminine)

Masculine form of two is also used with neuter nouns:

два міста - *two cities* (neuter); два села – *two villages* (neuter)

So, when using numerals “один” (one) and “два” (two) with nouns, match the gender form of a numeral and a noun:

один студент (masculine)

одн**а** студентк**а** (feminine)

одн**е** міст*о* (neuter)

два студенти (masculine plural)

дв**і** студентки (feminine plural)

##### About using numbers with nouns

In Ukrainian language nouns, when used with numerals, take different number and case forms. In this lesson you will learn different forms of nouns which are used with different numerals.

With numeral “one” and all numerals that end with “one” (21, 41, 191) nouns are used in Nominative singular form:

один рік/студент (Nominative singular masculine) одн**а** машина/студентка (Nominative singular feminine)

With numerals “two” “three” and “four” and all numerals that end with “two”, “three” and “four” (22, 43, 194, etc.) nouns are used in Nominative plural form:

два, три, чотири роки/студенти (Nominative plural masculine) дв**і**, три, чотири машини/студентки (Nominative plural feminine)

With all other numerals nouns are used in Genitive plural form:

5, 6, 7, 8 … років/студентів/машин/студенток (Genitive plural)

Numbers 11, 12, 13, and 14 are exception to this rule. They all are followed with nouns in Genitive plural form:

11, 12, 13, 14 … років/студентів/машин/студенток (Genitive plural)

The rule of making Genitive Plural of nouns is pretty complicated and is not explained in this course. We recommend you to just memorize the Genitive form of nouns you will use in this lesson.

| Nominative singular                                | Nominative plural                                                               | Genitive plural                                 |
|:-------------------------------------------------- |:------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |:----------------------------------------------- |
| used with numeral 1 and all numerals ending with 1 | used with numerals 2,3,4 and all numerals ending with 2,3,4, except for "teens" | used with all other numerals, including "teens" |
| рік                                                | роки                                                                            | рок**ів**                                       |
| студент                                            | студенти                                                                        | студент**ів**                                   |
| машина                                             | машини                                                                          | машин                                           |
| студентка                                          | студентки                                                                       | студенток                                       |

##### About telling age in Ukrainian

The way we say our age in Ukrainian is quite different from English. A word-to-word translation of a phrase “мені 20 років” is “to me it is 20 years”. Pronoun “**мені**” here is a Dative form of a personal pronoun”**я**” (I). So, to tell and ask about age in Ukrainian follow the pattern:

Personal Pronoun in Dative Case + number + рік/роки/років.

| Nom. Pers. Pron. | Gen. Pers. Pron. |                 | Example                                                                      |
|:---------------- |:---------------- |:--------------- |:---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Я →              | **Мені** +       | …рік/роки/років | **Мені** 21 рік. – *I am 21.*                                                |
| Ви →             | **Вам** +        | …рік/роки/років | Скільки **вам** років? – *How old are you?* **Вам** 24 роки? - *Are you 24?* |
