# Hiragana 1

### Welcome to the Japanese course!

While many consider Japanese to be very difficult to learn for native English speakers, this is only partially true. Many aspects of the Japanese language are quite simple, such as the sound system, and yes, even most of the grammar.

### Writing Systems

Japanese uses three different writing systems, **hiragana**, **katakana**, and **kanji**.

**Hiragana** is the most basic Japanese syllabary. It's like an alphabet that uses **syllables** instead of individual **sounds**.

**Katakana** is the syllabary used to write foreign words and some noises. Although it's different from hiragana, it represents the exact same **syllables**.

**Kanji** are Chinese characters used in the Japanese language to write individual nouns, verbs, and adjectives. Kanji are not phonetic, meaning you need to memorize each pronunciation individually. In this course, we introduce kanji gradually and methodically.

### Hiragana Pronunciation

Below are the most basic forms of Japanese hiragana. We'll be introducing some more later as well.

| を        | [o], although it's most often romanized as "wo"                                                                           |
| ん        | [n] or [ŋ], like the *n* in *pink*, producing a [m] when combined with a bilabial stop, hence "tempura" and not "tenpura" |

As the only solitary consonant in hiragana, **ん** is especially notable because it is only found at the end of another syllable. In other words, you will never read a Japanese word that begins with **ん**。

| や        | [ja]                                                                                                                      |
| ゆ        | [jɯ]                                                                                                                      |

| を        | [o], although it's most often romanized as "wo"                                                                           |
| ん        | [n] or [ŋ], like the *n* in *pink*, producing a [m] when combined with a bilabial stop, hence "tempura" and not "tenpura" |

As the only solitary consonant in hiragana, **ん** is especially notable because it is only found at the end of another syllable. In other words, you will never read a Japanese word that begins with **ん**。

# Hiragana 4

**In the following skill, we introduce a few more elements to basic hiragana.**

### Hiragana Part II: Dakuten

Putting two little dashes or **dakuten** at the upper right corner of a hiragana syllable **voices the consonant**. It changes the pronunciation of the hiragana in the following way:

| Sound | Sound with Dakuten | Example                                    |
|:----- |:------------------ |:------------------------------------------ |
| k     | g                  | か (ka) → が (**ga**)                        |
| s     | z                  | さ (sa) → ざ (**za**), し (shi) → じ (**ji**)* |
| t     | d                  | た (ta) → だ (**da**), つ (tsu) → づ (**zu**)* |
| h     | b                  | は (ha) → ば (**ba**)                        |

Putting a little circle or **handakuten** at the upper right corner changes the pronunciation of the は-ひ-ふ-へ-ほ hiragana in the following way:

| Sound | Sound with Handakuten | Example             |
|:----- |:--------------------- |:------------------- |
| h     | p                     | は (ha) → ぱ (**pa**) |

### Hiragana Part III: Small っ

Putting a っ (small tsu) between two hiragana syllables doubles the letter right after っ and introduces a short pause between two sounds. See some examples below:

| Without っ   | With っ            |
|:----------- |:----------------- |
| きて (kite)   | きって (ki**tt**e)   |
| もと (moto)   | もっと (mo**tt**o)   |
| あさり (asari) | あっさり (a**ss**ari) |

### Hiragana Part IV: Big and Small Characters

Lastly, this skill introduces the big and small versions of three sounds in hiragana. A small や、ゆ、or よ changes the pronunciation of a word in the following way:

| Big や-ゆ-よ  | Small や-ゆ-よ |
|:---------- |:----------- |
| きや [ki-ya] | きゃ [kya]    |
| きゆ [ki-yu] | きゅ [kyu]    |
| きよ [ki-yo] | きょ [kyo]    |

The small character changes the two-syllable construction into a one-syllable construction. Sometimes, the difference can lead to a real change in meaning, as shown below:

| Big よ                           | Small よ                   |
|:------------------------------- |:------------------------- |
| びよういん [bi-yō-in] "beauty salon" | びょういん [byō-in] "hospital" |

# Greetings

### Saying Thank You

The phrase "thank you" in Japanese is dependent on the situation. Below is a table of the most common forms, from least to most formal. Note that the formality increases with the length of the phrase.

| Japanese      | Explanation                                                         |
|:------------- |:------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| どうも           | **Thanks**, used with friends.                                      |
| ありがとう         | **Thank you**, used with friends.                                   |
| どうもありがとう      | **Thank you very much**, used with friends.                         |
| ありがとうございます    | **Thank you**, used with strangers, teachers, and bosses.           |
| どうもありがとうございます | **Thank you very much**, used with strangers, teachers, and bosses. |

#### Saying Thank You for a Past Action

If you'd like to thank someone for something they did in the past, you change the ございます ending to ございました。

| Japanese       | Explanation                                                                          |
|:-------------- |:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ありがとうございました    | **Thank you for what you did**, used with strangers, teachers, and bosses.           |
| どうもありがとうございました | **Thank you very much for what you did**, used with strangers, teachers, and bosses. |

# Katakana 1

#### Katakana

This lesson will begin introducing katakana. Like hiragana, katakana is a Japanese phonetic writing system. It's used for several things, but one of the most common uses is for foreign words.

| フ        | [ɸɯ], roughly between a short "hoo" and "foo"                                                                             |

| シ        | [ɕi], like the *shee* in *sheep*                                                                                          |

#### Katakana with Dakuten

| Japanese | IPA, Notes                      |
|:-------- |:------------------------------- |
| ギ        | [gi]                            |
| ジ        | [dʑi], like the *jee* in *jeep* |

| ピ        | [pi]                            |

If you sound out the words below using katakana characters, you might find some familiar words! Some of the pronunciation is a little different than its English equivalent, though.

| Japanese | Romaji    | English                   |
|:-------- |:--------- |:------------------------- |
| カメラ      | kamera    | camera                    |
| アメリカ     | Amerika   | the US                    |
| マリア      | Maria     | Maria (female given name) |
| アフリカ     | Afurika   | Africa                    |
| メキシコ     | Mekishiko | Mexico                    |
| フランス     | Furansu   | France                    |
| エリカ      | Erika     | Erika (female given name) |
| マリオ      | Mario     | Mario (male given name)   |

Just be careful - not all words written in katakana were taken from English!

| Japanese | Romaji  | English |
|:-------- |:------- |:------- |
| イギリス     | Igirisu | the UK  |
| イタリア     | Itaria  | Italy   |
| ローマ      | Rōma    | Rome    |

Not all foreign loan words in Japanese are directly equivalent to their English counterparts! For instance, in Japanese **アメリカ** (Amerika) isn't commonly used to refer to all of North America or to both North and South America - it's used almost exclusively to mean "the United States." However, **イギリス** (Igirisu) can be used to refer to both "the UK" and "England."

# Introduction

### Introduction to Kanji

This lesson introduces the non-phonetic writing system of Japanese, kanji. **Kanji** literally means "Chinese characters," and they're used to build content words like nouns, verbs, and adjectives.

#### Kanji Readings

So how do you read kanji? Most kanji have at least two possible readings. Typically, one reading is derived from a native Japanese word, and one reading is derived from a Chinese loanword. These are called "kunyomi" ("meaning reading") and "onyomi" ("sound reading") respectively.

Let's take the kanji for "country," **国**。On its own, we use the Japanese "kunyomi" reading, くに。In Japanese, くに means "country." However, in compounds, we use the "onyomi" reading of こく。Therefore, China, **中国** or "middle country," is read as ちゅうごく。

#### Rendaku

So why isn't it ちゅうこく？This is due to a phenomenon known as "rendaku" or "sequential voicing." Syllables that come later in a word are sometimes voiced and marked with a dakuten. This is often rather unpredictable, so rendaku words should be memorized individually.

#### Example Kanji

Below is a table of the six kanji that are introduced in this lesson, complete with possible readings.

| Kanji | Meaning      | Kunyomi Reading | Onyomi Reading |
|:----- |:------------ |:--------------- |:-------------- |
| 人     | Person       | ひと              | じん、にん          |
| 中     | Middle       | なか              | ちゅう            |
| 国     | Country      | くに              | こく             |
| 日     | Sun, Day     | ひ               | にち、じつ          |
| 本     | Origin, Book | もと              | ほん             |
| 田     | Rice Paddy   | た               | でん             |

You may have noticed that the word Japan, or **日本** is composed of the kanji meaning "sun" and "origin." This word was first adopted by the Chinese, and to them, Japan was off to the east, the place where the sun rose or "originated."

### Katakana Pronunciation

This lesson also introduces katakana, the phonetic Japanese writing system used for foreign words. See their pronunciation below.

#### Basic Katakana

# Introduction 2

### Basic Grammar

One thing that makes Japanese very different from English is the Japanese tendency to **drop the subject of the sentence** when the meaning is clear from context. Statements usually refer to oneself, while questions usually address the person you're speaking with.

#### The Question Marker

Adding question marker **か** at the end will make the affirmative (positive) sentence into question. If the sentences end in ～です, it’s easy to formulate questions by using ～ですか。

| Positive                | Question                         |
|:----------------------- |:-------------------------------- |
| アメリカ人です。(I’m American.) | アメリカ人です**か**。(Are you American?) |
| がくせいです。(I’m a student.) | がくせいです**か**。(Are you a student?) |

#### Pronouns

Pronouns are relatively rare in Japanese, but they are sometimes used to explicitly specify the subject or topic of a sentence. Below are some of the most common ones.

| Person         | Singular                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Plural                                                                                                   |
|:-------------- |:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| First          | 私・わたし is used in polite settings by women and men, used by women in most other settings. 僕・ぼく is used by men in informal settings.                                                                                                            | 私たち・わたしたち is most common. 我々・われわれ sounds rather stiff and business-like.                                 |
| Second         | あなた is used in polite settings, however, if you know someone's name, it's best to call them by their name, typically followed by さん or せんせい。君・きみ is used by men in informal settings, specifically to those on or beneath one's social level. | あなたたち is used in formal settings, and 君たち・きみたち is used in informal settings, especially to subordinates. |
| Third - Male   | 彼・かれ                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 彼ら・かれら is also used for a mixed-gendered group                                                           |
| Third - Female | 彼女・かのじょ                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 彼女たち・かのじょたち                                                                                              |
