# Basics 1

## Fáilte | Welcome!

Welcome to Duolingo's Irish course! In this course you will learn the official standard (**an Caighdeán Oifigiúil**) of Irish. But note, this is a written, and not a spoken standard. Irish is spoken in three main dialects, corresponding to three Irish provinces of Munster (south), Ulster (north), and Connacht (west). The audio in this course was recorded by a native speaker of the Connacht dialect.

So what makes Irish different? What might challenge you as you try to learn? Well, tonnes of things! To be honest, even the basics of Irish are very different from what you're probably used to.

The best advice we can give is that with Irish, learning things off by heart and trying to base your learning on grammar will only get you so far. It's a very irregular language, and most rules that try to generalise come with many exceptions.

Just take it as slowly as you need to, and nothing should challenge you very much. There is a really good article about some of the more fascinating peculiarities here: https://multikulti.wordpress.com/2014/09/15/10-reasons-why-irish-is-an-absolutely-awesome-language/

We'll also address a couple below. So let's get started then!

------

#### Intro

The Irish alphabet is short and sweet:

**a b c d e f g h i l m n o p r s t u**

The vowels can take an added accent, the **fada** (pronounced 'foddah'):

**á é í ó ú**

The *fada* lengthens and alters the sound on the vowel.

The rest of the English alphabet, **j k q v w x y z**, especially v, is gradually being naturalised into Irish due to the many loanwords we take in.

#### Word Order

Most English sentences use the "Subject-Verb-Object" word order. For example, in the sentence *He eats food*, *he* is the subject, *eats* is the verb, and *food* is the object.

In Irish, a slightly different word order is used: "V-S-O". Here is the same sentence in Irish: **Itheann sé bia**. The verb in this sentence is **itheann** (a form of the verb *to eat*), the subject is **sé** (*he*), and the object is **bia** (*food*).

In summary: Irish sentences start with their verbs!

- **Ith**im *bia* | I **eat** *food*
- **Itheann** an fear *bia* | The man **eats** *food*
- **Ólann** sí *bainne* | She **drinks** *milk*

------

#### To be, or not to be...

Irish makes it interesting when you want to say what something "is", because you need to choose the right version of the verb "to be"! There are two versions. called **bí** and **an chopail**.

- **Bí** is Irish for *to be*, and is one of only eleven irregular verbs in the whole language. *That's handy!*

| bí             | to be           |
|:-------------- |:--------------- |
| tá mé/táim     | I am            |
| tá tú          | you (sing.) are |
| tá sé          | he/it is        |
| tá sí          | she/it is       |
| tá muid/táimid | we are          |
| tá sibh        | you (pl.) are   |
| tá siad        | they are        |

Notes: tá + mé (I) = táim, tá + muid (we) = táimid. These contractions are called the synthetic form.

- **An chopail** (the *copula*) is a defective verb with its own funky grammar. It doesn't even follow the normal word order rules! The word you are talking about goes in the middle.

| copail           | copula          |
|:---------------- |:--------------- |
| is ... mé        | I am            |
| is ... tú        | you (sing.) are |
| is ... é         | he/it is        |
| is ... í         | she/it is       |
| is ... sinn/muid | we are          |
| is ... sibh      | you (pl.) are   |
| is ... iad       | they are        |

The copula is for when you're **introducing** something or someone, like "Is bean í" (She is a woman) or "Is úll é" (It is an apple). Bí is for when you're **describing** something or someone, like "Tá sí ard" (She is tall) or "Tá sé blasta" (It is tasty). You'll learn the basics of both here, and later you'll learn some more about each of them!

# Basics 2

## Buntús 2 | Basics 2

You're still here. That's wonderful! We'll start with a strange but important little rule:

#### "Caol le caol agus leathan le leathan."

This is the *golden rule* of Irish spelling and it is important for all sorts of things all the time. It's actually quite a consistent and well-observed rule across Irish, which is very rare. You should get very used to it, to the point that a word which doesn't follow the rule will stand out to you.

The phrase literally means "slender with slender and broad with broad", and it refers to vowels in a word.

Slender vs broad is a way to group the vowels in two distinct groups:

| **leathan** *broad* | **caol** *slender* |
|:------------------- |:------------------ |
| a                   | e                  |
| o                   | i                  |
| u                   |                    |

The rule says that the vowels on either side of any *consonant* should match: they should both be slender, or both be broad. It's actually an important rule, because certain consonants, especially **s** and **t** will change their sound appreciably depending on whether they are slender or broad.

To see if the stem of a verb is broad or slender, look at the last vowel in that stem.

For example, take the verbs **dún** and **bris**. The last vowel in **dún** is broad, so you would use broad endings when conjugating this verb. Similarly you would use slender endings when conjugating **bris**.

------

#### A bit about Verbs

We do have two present tenses in Irish, which function just like in English. Let's start with the present habitual. This describes what one does on a regular basis, not what one is doing right now. Verbs in Irish are split into three main groups: the first conjugation, the second conjugation and the irregular verbs.

------

#### 1. The first conjugation

*Basically*, these verbs have only one syllable. In the present tense the ending is, generally, added directly onto the stem. Examples are **dún** ("close"), **ól** ("drink"), **bris** ("break")

Examples:

- **dúnaim** *I close*
- **dúnann sé** *he closes*
- **brisim** *I break*
- **briseann sé** *he breaks*
- **ólaimid** *we drink*

Notice how sometimes it takes two words, and sometimes just one. In present tense verbs, **mé** and **muid** are often not used; they can be incorporated into their verb to make the 'synthetic form'.

------

#### 2. The second conjugation

These verbs have more than one syllable. To conjugate and use them correctly takes a bit more intuition, but you'll be *grand*!

The words come in two halves for you to identify. They will have a root and a stem. To conjugate them, you will remove the stem and replace it with an appropriate ending. There aren't too many endings to learn.

Examples of 2nd-conjugation verbs are *bailigh, ceannaigh, oscail,* and *inis*. Watch how their stems are removed/altered to take the ending:

- **bailíonn tú** *you collect*
- **ceannaímid** *we buy*
- **insím** *I tell*
- **osclaíonn sibh** *you open*

------

#### 3. Irregular verbs

Oh no, a different beast altogether... No hassle, there are only 11 of these! Some of them appear quite regular most of the time, but all of them have at least one tense in which they don't obey the standard rules, so it is necessary to memorise these 11 verbs in all their forms and tenses! Just to warn you, they are:

- **abair** *say*
- **beir** *bear/carry/bring*
- **bí** *be*
- **clois** *hear*
- **déan** *do/make*
- **feic** *see*
- **faigh** *get*
- **ith** *eat*
- **tabhair** *give*
- **tar** *come*
- **téigh** *go*

But seriously, they're not that bad.

# Common Phrases

## Welcome to Phrases!

#### Hello!

The formal way to greet someone is by saying **Dia duit**. Literally this means *God to you*. Here is something to note:

- **Dia duit** is used when greeting one person.
- **Dia daoibh** is used when greeting more than one person.

The proper response is **Dia is Muire duit**, which literally means *God and Mary to you*.

- **Dia is Muire duit** is used when replying to one person.
- **Dia is Muire daoibh** is used when replying to more than one person.

**Note on the Sociology of Ireland**: These forms are old, formal, and in sharp decline. There is a complicated relationship between Ireland and the Catholic church in recent history, and many younger speakers consciously avoid the nearly-obsolete religious constructions of yore. We don't *officially* teach you this here, because we decided to stick with The Standard so we *have* to teach you *"dia duit"* and so on. Just be aware you're more likely to hear somebody greet you with a typical English greeting like "hiya", or even by avoiding a "hello" and just asking how you are – Conas atá tú? –

------

#### To have

We don't say "have" in Irish, that's way too simple and direct. Instead the verb **bí** (*be*) is used together with the preposition **ag** (*at*).

To express that you have something, you say that it is "at you" - implying that it is close by you, in your possession. If you want to say *Paul has a book*, think of this as meaning *A book is at Paul*, or *There is a book at Paul* . The Irish for this is **Tá leabhar ag Pól**.

When you want to write *at* followed by a pronoun, the two words join together to make a "prepositional pronoun". For example, **ag** and **mé** combine to form **agam** (*at me*). Here is **ag** in all its forms:

| English           | Irish  |
|:----------------- |:------ |
| at                | ag     |
| at me             | agam   |
| at you (singular) | agat   |
| at him            | aige   |
| at her            | aici   |
| at us             | againn |
| at you (plural)   | agaibh |
| at them           | acu    |

Examples of **bí** + **ag**:

- **Tá oráiste agam** *I have an orange*
- **Tá pláta acu** *They have a plate*
- **Tá cailín ag Pól** *Paul has a girl/girlfriend*

------

#### To speak or to have?

When talking about languages in Irish there are distinct ways to translate the two meanings of the English "speak".

1) "I speak Irish" would translate as "Labhraím Gaeilge" if "speak" was referring to the act of speaking the language ("I speak Irish every day")

2) "I speak Irish" would translate as "Tá Gaeilge agam" (literally "I have Irish") if "speak" was referring to the ability to speak, or the knowledge of, the language.

So when you say "I (can) speak [language]", in Irish you literally say "I have [language]"
