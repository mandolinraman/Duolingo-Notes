# Alphabet 1

Russian uses a version of the Cyrillic Alphabet. Many letters look similar to their Latin counterparts. Cyrillic typography was remodeled about 300 years ago, so both alphabets have a similar style.

*We'll start with some simple sentences right away. Russian does not have articles, nor does it normally use the verb “to be” in the Present tense.*

(*sentences like "Bob is an actor" are usually punctuated with a dash:* «Боб — актёр»)

### Letters and Sounds

**К**, **О**, **М**, **Т**, **А** sound similar to their Latin counterparts (to be more precise, "о" is the sound in "more"). However, in handwriting and typed italics, the letter **Т** can look rather like a lower case 'm' in the Latin alphabet (это→*это*).

**Е** actually sounds more like "ye", as in "yell", not as in "Hear ye, hear ye!" (this will work for now; it's more complicated after a consonant).

**В** sounds like 'v', **Б** sounds like 'b'. **Н** is "n" and **И** is "i" ('eeh'). The remaining letters are included in the table below:

|                   |                 |                |
|:----------------- |:--------------- |:-------------- |
| Ёё⁰ (**you**r)    | Вв (**v**ase)   | Бб (**b**ed)   |
| Ээ (r**e**d)      | Нн¹ (**n**ap)   | Дд¹ (**d**ab)  |
| Уу (s**oo**n)     | Хх² (Ba**ch**)  | Гг (**g**ap)   |
| Ии (m**ee**t)     | Йй (**y**es)    | Лл¹ (ni**l**)  |
| Юю (**you**)      | Рр (trilled R)  | Пп (**p**oor)  |
| Ыы³ (h**i**t)     | Сс (**S**am)    | Зз (**z**ebra) |
| Яя (**ya**rd)     | Фф (**ph**oton) | Цц (ca**ts**)  |
| Жж⁴ (sei**z**ure) | Шш⁴ (**sh**un)  | Щщ⁴            |
| Чч (**ch**eer)    |                 | Ъ and Ь⁵       |

- ⁰ **Ёё** The umlaut-like double dots are optional in writing. Syllables containing this letter are always stressed.
- ¹ **т, д, н, л** are pronounced near your teeth.
- ² **х**('kh') is somewhat similar to the "H" in "hue". It is like making the "sh" sound, only it is pronounced where you make the "K" sound.
- ³ **ы** has no equivalent in English. It is an "eeh"-like sound, but less distinct, sounds closer to "e" in "lover", and has your tongue deeper than in "heat" or "hit".
- ⁴ for **ш** and **ж** your tongue is lower than in English and slightly bent back. **Щ** has all your tongue raised—it is a longer and more hissy sound. **Ч** corresponds to **щ** (i.e. a bit different than "ch").
- ⁵ **ъ** and **ь** are separators and have no sound.

**Л** can have a flat top, like **П**, or a pointy top like **А** (it comes from the Greek Λ). Д and Л have a similar top in many fonts, though it's up to the designer. Handwritten **Д** looks like *D*, and **д** like a *g* or a *д* (the last two affect the italic shapes).

An Italic **Г** in lower case usually looks this: *г*.

That's it with the introduction! We will discuss reading words in more detail in later skills.

P.S. In our notes, we use an acute accent to show you the stress (e.g., ра́дио). It is a standard practice in Russian textbooks for little children or foreign learners—and, generally, the most common way of marking the position of the stress.

# Basics 1

### Welcome to our course!

Now you are ready to proceed to the main part of the tree!

We are happy that you have chosen our Russian course. Just to make it clear, we are using American English in this course—but don't worry, we will accept most versions of English where appropriate. Just be careful around expressions like "bathroom" or "1st floor", because these may mean different things than what you are used to.

As for Russian, we teach the standard language, which is based on the variation spoken around Moscow and Saint Petersburg, and we stick to the usage typical of these cities. Do not worry, though: for more than one reason Russian is rather uniform over the territory of Russia (still, there is some variation in pronunciation and a few items of everyday vocabulary). We try to stay neutral in style, with occasional trips into formal and informal language.

### Cases and word order

Russian is an inflected language, so the (declensions) of nouns and modifying adjectives correspond to their role in the sentence.

These forms are called **cases**. Russian has 6 cases: Nominative, Accusative, Genitive, Prepositional, Dative and Instrumental. The Nominative is the dictionary form; as for the others, we are going to cover them gradually, one by one.

This allows for a more loose word order. But not random! A typical word order is *subject—verb—object*. “Old” information (the things you tell *about*) is normally closer to the beginning of the sentence which is probably why pronouns are often found closer to the beginning of a sentence than a noun would be :

- *I know him.* → Я **его́** зна́ю.
- *I know Maria.* → Я зна́ю **Мари́ю**.

That includes words like “here”, “in this way”, “then” and so on.

Unlike English, adverbs are NOT universally grouped at the end. So pay attention to the typical positions for the expressions of time, place and manner. Eg. “very much” is typically in the end-position in English, but in Russian it is just before the thing that is "very" or “very much”:

- *She likes to read **very much*** = Она́ **о́чень** лю́бит чита́ть

Good luck!

### Vowel reduction

Like in English, vowel letters aren't *all* pronounced just like in the alphabet. In Russian, unstressed syllables have vowels *reduced*:

- **А and О** become the same uh-sound
- **И and Е** (Э) become the same sound similar to "i" in "hit"
- **Я** actually becomes an i-like sound, not an uh-like (except in a few words). This also affects "а" after ч, ш, щ, ж or ц in many words (sadly, not all).

So, when a vowel is not stressed, it becomes weaker, somewhat shorter, and also some vowels become indistinguishable.

### More on the case system

For now, we will only be studying simple sentences that either use the dictionary form, the *Nominative* case, or use the *Accusative* (direct object of an action), which has the same form for many classes of nouns.

The case is defined by its use. Nevertheless, these forms have names, usually calques from Latin that reflect some typical use (but not the only one):

- Nominative (subject)
- Accusative (direct object)
- Genitive ("of" something)
- Prepositional (place or topic)
- Dative (recipient, "indirect" object)
- Instrumental (means of action)

As you can see, these names are of little use until you know what sentence, verb or preposition requires that you use that particular form.

Some nouns of foreign origin are *indeclinable*, i.e. all their forms are the same. This includes words like метро, Дженни or кафе.

# Phrases 1

### Hello

Russian has a more informal greeting **«Приве́т»** and a more formal **«Здра́вствуй(те)»**. Here, we focus on the first, since it is the shorter one.

**«Пожа́луйста»** (please) has another popular position in the sentence—namely, after the verb (more on that later).

• *you can also use* «пожа́луйста» *as a reply to "thanks", meaning "You are welcome!"*

### How are you?

The phrase for "How are you?" (Как дела́?) literally means "How are your affairs (the stuff you do)?"

No one uses it as a greeting, i.e. you are not expected to use it with people you barely know (or those you know, for that matter). And be prepared for a person to *actually* tell you how they've been doing. ;)

### Good morning!

Morning typically starts at 4 or 5 a.m., afternoon at noon, evening at 5 p.m. (at 6 for some) and night at 11 or at midnight.

You only use "Good night" (Споко́йной но́чи) when parting before sleep (or saying your goodbyes really late, so it is implied you or the listener are going to bed soon after).

*If you are advanced enough to have noticed oblique forms used in some phrases—you are right! Greetings and other similar expressions are often shortened versions of longer phrases, where words still retain their forms. For example,* «Споко́йной но́чи» *probably replaces the longer* «Я жела́ю вам споко́йной но́чи!» *(I wish you a peaceful night). Needless to say, the full version is never used.*

# Basics 2

### I have a cat

English prefers to express ownership and “possession” with the verb “have”. In Russian “existence” is almost universally used instead (in the official/academic style «иметь» *to have* is OK to use).

Use it like this:

- **У *A* есть *X*** ~ by A there is an X → A has an X

The owner is in the *Genitive case* (more on that later) while X is formally the subject. For now we will only study the Genitive form for some pronouns.

### You have wonderful eyes!

**Omit ”есть”** if the *existence* of the object is obvious or not the point — very typical for describing traits or a number of objects (“Tom has a beautiful smile/large eyes”, “She has a very fat cat”). This also applies to expressing temporary states and illnesses (“She has a migraine”).

### I eat/ She eats

In English, the only way a verb changes in the present tense is that you add -s for the 3rd person singular. In Russian, all 6 forms are different and fit two regular patterns.

However, ***eat*** «есть» and ***want*** «хоте́ть» are two of the four verbs that are irregular (that is, do not strictly follow either of the 2 patterns).

Note that the "present" tense is formed from one stem and the "past" and infinitive from the second one. In general, these two are slightly different. For now, don't worry about the infinitive stem.

### Hard and soft

Russian consonants are split into two groups of 15, which are pronounced in two different ways, *palatalized* (aka "soft") and *non-palatalized* (aka "hard"). We'll stick to the shorter "soft" and "hard" (sorry).

When a consonant is "soft" it means that you pronounce it with your tongue raised high; for "non-palatalized" consonants it stays low. Russian orthography has its history but, long story short, you can tell the "softness" of a consonant from a vowel letter spelled afterwards:

- **А, Ы, У, Э, О** follow "hard" consonants
- **Я, И, Ю, Е, Ё** follow palatalized ones

If there is nothing after a consonant, the soft sign Ь is used to show the softness. In consonant clusters palatalization is predictable from the softness of the last consonant. We aren't teaching it here. These days the trend is to only "soften" the last consonant in most clusters, while a hundred years ago some clusters were palatalized even without any obvious reason.

To show you how it works, here is an example, using an ad-hoc transcription:

- же́**нщ**ина = [жэнʲщиᵉна]
- **ст**ена́ = [стʲиᵉна] or [сʲтʲиᵉна]

There are dictionaries («орфоэпический словарь») that show the recommended pronunciation of words and contain general pronunciation rules, too.

### Voicing

Some consonants let your voice come out immediately (voiced) while others wait for the release of the consonant and only then let your voice escape (unvoiced). In Russian there are 6 pairs of such consonants: Б/П, В/Ф, Г/К, Д/Т, Ж/Ш, З/С.

- whenever one of these consonants (except В) follows another, the second overrides or reverses the voicing of the first: сд = [зд], вс= [фс]
- the end of the phrase is unvoiced: этот клуб *[клуп]*
- rules apply between the word boundaries, too
- Х, Ч, Ц, Щ also play this game, even though Russian lacks letters for their voiced partners ([ɣ], [дж'], [дз], [ж'ж']). They will devoice the preceding consonant or become voiced themselves.

# Name and polite "You"

### Thou art

Russian makes a distinction between **ты**, singular "you", and **вы**, plural "you" (y'all). The latter also doubles for "polite" you, with verbs also in plural. And don't forget that the "excuse" in "Excuse me" is a verb!

- Use **ты** with friends and your family members
- Use **вы** with adult strangers, your teachers and in other formal interactions (at the store, the doctor's, the airport etc.)
- People use **вы** with those who are much older
- Nobody is "polite" toward kids

### Grandson, son of Grand

As you might know if you ever read any Russian literature, Russians have three names; their first name and their surname—just like you have—and a *patronymic* (отчество), which is based on their father's name (отец = father). A very common 'polite' pattern is to use a person's first name and a patronymic:

- Ива́н Ива́нович, вы за́няты? = *Ivan Ivanovich, are you busy?*

In this course, **name+patronymic** are always used with the polite **вы**-form.

### What is your name?

«Как вас зову́т?» is literally "How (do) they call you?"

Russian has a casual diminutive form for many common names: Ива̓н→Ва́ня, Мари́я→Ма́ша, Алекса́ндр(Алекса́ндра)→Са́ша, Евге́ний(Евге́ния)→Же́ня, Еле́на→Ле́на, Алексе́й→Лёша, Пётр→Пе́тя. Needless to say, there's no "politeness" with these, but they are often used with some degree of affection.

### Excuse me...

Russian has two very common polite patterns for questions that English does not:

- **negative** questions give a shade of "by any chance": «Извини́те, вы не зна́ете Михаи́ла?» = *Excuse me, do you happen to know Mikhail?*
- **"Please tell"** when asking for information: «Скажи́те, пожа́луйста, где музе́й?» = *Excuse me, where is the museum?*

### Thank you

«Спаси́бо» is the word to use. A fancier option would be «Благодарю́!» (a form of the verb «благодари́ть», "to thank"), though quite a number of people use it, if only for variety.

# Plurals

Here is how the Nominative Plural is formed.

| TYPE                                 | Ending  | Example           |
|:------------------------------------ |:------- |:----------------- |
| **-а/-я** -nouns                     | **ы/и** | ма́мы, зе́мли     |
| **-ь** -nouns, feminine              | **и**   | крова́ти          |
| most **consonant-ending** masculines | **ы/и** | столы́, ма́льчики |
| **-о/-е** -nouns                     | **а/я** | о́кна, моря́      |
| some **consonant-ending** masculines | **а/я** | доктора́, глаза́  |

(so, the plural «я́блоки» is actually an uncommon way of doing it)

There are some irregular plurals too.

### Spelling Rules

Or maybe not. Sometimes Russian forces your choice of vowel to spell or pronounce after a certain letter.

**The 7-letter rule**: Whenever you make any form of a word, and you need to write И or Ы, check this:

- after К, Г, Х and Ш, Ж, Щ, Ч always use **И**

These are velars ("back" consonants) and hushes. For hushes, it is merely a spelling convention, owing to their former "soft" status. For velars, it is true to their pronunciation — i.e., these consonants always use the palatalized И where another consonant would use Ы:

- страна́ → стра́ны
- строка́ → стро́ки

Of these seven consonants, «К» should be your main concern for now. A lot of nouns have it as a suffix or a part of their suffix, forcing you to remember this rule.

**The 8-letter rule**: Whenever you make any form of a word, and you need to write А, У or Я, Ю after a consonant, follow the rule:

- after К, Г, Х , Ш, Ж, Щ, Ч **and Ц**, always use **А** or **У**

# Where is it?

Russian words take different forms depending on their role in the sentence. These forms are called **cases**. A few forms may look the same (cf. "frequent rains" vs. "It rains often").

These forms have names (mostly calques from Latin) that describe some "prototypal" use of such case: Nominative, Accusative, Genitive, Prepositional, Dative and Instrumental. For you, these are just tags: the use is what defines a case.

As of now, you know the NOMINATIVE case: the dictionary form of a word. This form acts as the *grammatical subject* of the sentence, the "doer". It is also used for both nouns in "A is B" structure:

- Мой па́па ест.
- Том — мой брат.

You also know a few Genitive forms (у **меня**) but that's it. For now, we will tackle something easier.

### Prepositional case

When we talk about things ***being*** somewhere, we typically use **в** (in) or **на** (on) with the Prepositional form of the noun. It doesn't work when you mean *motion* to that place!

The Prepositional case (a.k.a. Locative) is the only case that is *never* used on its own without a preposition, even though only four or five prepositions ever use it:

- Я на конце́рте. = I am at a concert.
- Я в шко́ле. = I am at (in) school.
- ви́део о шко́ле = a video about school

Unlike English (“at/in school”), in Russian each "place" is associated with just one preposition. The rough overall rule is: use “в” (in, at) when talking about buildings and places with certain boundaries and use “на” (on, at) when talking about open spaces or events:

- в до́ме *(in the house)*, в шко́ле *(at school)*, в ко́мнате *(in the room)*, в теа́тре *(in the theater)*, в кино́ *(at the cinema)*, в университе́те *(at the university)*
- на у́лице *(in the street, outdoors)*, на пло́щади *(at the square)*, на конце́рте *(at the concert)*, на уро́ке *(at the lesson)*, на корабле́ *(on a ship)*

When you mean physically being inside/on top of some object, there is little ambiguity. "Places", unfortunately, require memorization.

### Prepositional endings

Here is the rule that covers most nouns:

- feminine nouns ending in ь take **-и**
- nouns ending in -ия, -ий or -ие also take **-и** (so that they end in -ии instead)
- all other nouns take **-е**

### What about me and my friends?

Use “у + Genitive” when talking about being at some *person’s* place: Да, я у дру́га = *Yeah, I am at my friend’s place*.

### ▲▼WC

The room with a toilet is **туале́т**. In this course, we stick to the North American "bathroom", even though a room with a bath is, technically ва́нная (it has ва́нна, "a bath"). Still, in Russian you would not ask for a "bath-room" unless you really mean it.

### And what if I gotta go away?

We’ll deal with that later. But the pattern is consistent. When you ***are*** somewhere, going ***to*** that place and going ***away*** from that place, use the following triplets:

| AT            | TO           | FROM         |
|:------------- |:------------ |:------------ |
| **в** + Prep  | **в** + Acc  | **из** + Gen |
| **на** + Prep | **на** + Acc | **с** + Gen  |
| **у** + Gen   | **к** + Dat  | **от** + Gen |

For example, if the place is used with на, the correct prepositions for the three uses are на–на–с.

### "Spelling rules"

Note how plurals of «соба́ка» and «ко́шка» end in И: соба́ки, ко́шки, even though you might expect А to turn into Ы.

There are some restrictions on which consonants are used with which vowels when making word forms. Here are the rules for **и, а, у** vs. **ы, я, ю**:

- use only И, not Ы, after **к, г, х**/ **ж, ш, щ, ч**
- use only А, У after **к, г, х**/ **ж, ш, щ, ч** and **ц** (and never use Я, Ю after them)

*К, Г, Х* are called velar consonants (i.e. made in the back) and *Ш, Щ, Ж, Ч* are often called *hushes*. The latter do not show palatalized/non-palatalized pairs in modern Russian, so the spelling rule does not affect pronunciation anyhow. It's just a convention.

### Fleeting vowels

It is not too important for you at the moment, but you may notice how О and Е sometimes appear in consonant clusters or disappear from them. For example:

- Э́то лев. = This is a lion.
- В зоопа́рке нет льва́. = There isn't a lion at the zoo.

------

*Later you will encounter the Genitive plural (often used with numbers and words like "many" or "few"), which shows a simple pattern for **-к**-suffixed feminine nouns that do not have a vowel before "-ка":*

- много кошек = *many cats*
- много девочек = *many girls*
- много уток = *many ducks*
- много тарелок = *many plates*

*As you can see, the vowel (О or Е) depends on whether the previous consonant is palatalized or not. Hushes behave as if they were palatalized, despite Ж and Ш having lost this quality in the modern language.*

# Genitive Case 1

In Russian “I have” is expressed by «У меня (есть)» structure. The owner is in the *Genitive case*.

### Genitive

"The **of**-case". It is one of the most universal cases. How do you make the forms? Here is the regular pattern:

| ***ENDING***                             |              | **Genitive sg.**      |     | soft stem |           |
|:---------------------------------------- |:------------ |:--------------------- |:--- |:--------- |:--------- |
| **-a/-я**                                | мама         | мам**ы**              |     | земля     | земл**и** |
| **zero-ending** *masc*, **-о/-е** *neut* | сок / молоко | сок**а** / молок**а** |     | конь      | кон**я**  |
| **-ь** *fem*                             | мышь         | мыш**и**              |     |           |           |

*A **zero** ending means that the word ends in a consonant or a soft sign (which is just a way to show the final consonant is "soft"). In the Nominative singular, a Russian word can only have the following endings:* **а, я, о, е, ё** *or **nothing** ("zero ending").*

### Genitive of Negation

If you use «нет» to say that there is "no" something or you do not have it, the object is always in Genitive:

У меня́ есть я́блоко → У меня́ нет **я́блока**

Здесь есть рюкза́к → Здесь нет **рюкзака́**.

### Major uses

- **"of" (possession)**: яблоко мам**ы** = mom's apple
- **"of" (amount)**: чашка ча**я**, много ча**я** = a cup of tea, a lot of tea

A huge number of prepositions require this case. Yes, «у меня есть», «У неё есть» only use «меня» and «неё» because «у» wants Genitive.

For *он*, *она* and *оно* Genitive doubles as a non-changing possessive "his", "her", "their": **его, её, их**.

- initial «н» is used for him/her/them with the majority of prepositions (doesn't affect possessives)

### Indeclinable nouns

A little side note: some nouns of foreign origin are indeclinable. It means that all their forms are the same. Foreign nouns that end in о/е become like that (кофе, метро, радио, резюме), as well as all nouns that do not fit into Russian declension patterns (see above).

This includes female names that end in anything other than А or Я. A few **-ь**-ending names are an exception (Любовь and Biblical names like Юдифь).

So, all of the following names are automatically indeclinable: Маргарет, Мэри, Элли, Дженни, Рэйчел, Натали, Энн, Ким, Тесс, Жасмин.

### I am away

Russian also uses the Genitive to state that someone is "away", "not there": *Мамы сейчас нет*. In English such use would correspond to "There is no mom at the moment", or even "There is no me now". We are not hard on that particular construction in the course, but it is important to know it all the same.

*Added bonus: when a verb directly acts on a noun, the noun is called* ***a direct object*** *and is in Accusative. In Russian, only -а/-я nouns have a unique form for it. Others just reuse the Genitive or don't change anything (Nominative)*

### Nothing

Russian uses.... let's call it "consistent" negation. It means that in negative sentences you are *required* to use "nothing" instead of "anything", "nowhere" instead of "somewhere" and so on. Let's meet the first of these pronouns:

- У меня **ничего** нет. = I don't have anything.
- Она **ничего** не ест. = She doesn't eat anything.

You'll also notice that, unlike standard English, Russian has no rule against using double negatives.

# Possessives and Gender

### Russian possessives

There isn't much to say about words like "my" or "your" in Russian.

- **his/her/their** do not change: **его́, её, их** (and they don't get an initial Н after prepositions!)

- my/your/our

  roughly follow an adjectival pattern, i.e. they copy the gender and the case of the noun they describe. Just like этот:

> - мой/твой/наш папа
> - мо**я́**/тво**я́**/на́ш**а** ма́ма

Unlike English, no distinction is made between *my* and *mine*, *her* and *hers* etc.

**Pronunciation**: in «его», as well as in adjective endings and "сегодня" the letter **Г** is pronounced **В**. It is a historical spelling.

### Grammatical gender

Nouns in Russian belong to one of three genders: feminine, masculine or neuter. If a noun means a person of a certain gender, use that one. For all other nouns look at the end of the word:

| ending in Nom.sg. | gender                                      | examples                                                      |
|:----------------- |:------------------------------------------- |:------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **-а/-я**         | feminine                                    | ма́ма, земля́, Росси́я, маши́на                               |
| **consonant**     | masculine                                   | сок, ма́льчик, чай, интерне́т, апельси́н                      |
| **-о/-е**         | neuter                                      | окно́, яйцо́, мо́ре                                           |
| **-ь**            | feminine or masculine; consult a dictionary | ло́шадь, ночь, мать, любо́вь / день, конь, медве́дь, учи́тель |

If there is a soft sign, it is not possible to easily predict the gender. However, among the most common **-ь**-ending nouns 65–70% are feminine. Some suffixes end in a soft sign; they always produce the same gender:

- **-ость/-есть*,* -знь** → feminine (e.g., жизнь)
- **-тель, -арь, -ырь** → masculine (e.g., учитель)

------

*All nouns with **-чь, щь, -шь, -жь** at the end are feminine. The convention is to spell masculine ones without the soft sign:* нож, луч, муж, душ. *It does not affect pronunciation, anyway.*
