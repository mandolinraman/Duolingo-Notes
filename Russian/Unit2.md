# Partitive

The Genitive case has many uses in Russian.

One of them is expressing *an amount*:

- чашка чая = a cup of tea
- тарелка риса = a plate of rice
- корзина яблок = a basket of apples

With mass nouns it is also used to express "some" unspecified amount when used instead of the Accusative:

- Я хочу воды = I want (some) water.
- Дайте, пожалуйста, риса. = lit. "Give me, please, some rice".

The usage is only typical when you ask or hypothesize about using "some amount" of stuff. You cannot actually say you are drinking "воды" right now—but you can say you want some (or sipped some in the past—with a perfective¹, of course).

### чашка чаю

«Чай» has an alternative Partitive form «чаю»:

- Хочешь чашечку чаю? = Want a cup of tea?

It is optional. Some short masculine nouns that denote substances have such form. «Чай» is among the few that are immensely popular in speech and do not sound old-fashioned.

### стакан

Russian differentiates between a number of drinking vessels. **Стака́н** is what you call a "glass" in English: typically, a cylindrical glass vessel with no handle. As a measurement unit (used in cooking) it is the same as English "cup".

- a beer/wine glass is «бока́л»
- a small wine glass is «рю́мка»

------

¹ *Perfective is an **aspect**. Russian has verbs of two flavors: those that denote "processes" and those that mean "events" (events are never used in the present).*

# The Accusative: the Direct Object

### Accusative

Until now, you've been using the base form of the word in sentences like «Он ест **яблоко**».

Actually, whenever a verb, like "read", "cut" or "want" acts *directly* on some noun, the latter is a *direct object*. Such nouns take the Accusative case.

### Formation

Only nouns ending in **-а** / **-я** have a separate, unique form. «Мама» is a good example of this class :

- ма́ма → ма́м**у**

Neuter nouns and feminine nouns with a final **-ь** (e.g., «мы́шь») just reuse the Nominative form.

Now we are left with masculine nouns ending in a consonant (сок, медве́дь, брат). They use the same form as their Nominative or Genitive:

- living beings ("animate") copy the Genitive
- objects ("inanimate") stay Nominative
- in the plural, **this rule applies to all Russian nouns**

| **-а/-я** | **—** (masc.) | **neuter** | **-ь** (fem.) |
|:--------- |:------------- |:---------- |:------------- |
| **-у/-ю** | Nom. / Gen.   | Nominative | Nominative    |

*With "substances"(mass nouns), the* ***Genitive*** *form may be used instead. It conveys the meaning of "some" quantity.*

*Verbs that take a direct object are called **transitive**. Too bad that some verbs transitive in Russian are intransitive in English ("wait") and vice versa ("like")!*

### I want it

Russian verbs have two main ending patterns. We are going to introduce them very soon.

Unfortunately, the verb «хоте́ть»(to want) is irregular and mixes both. On a brighter note, it is very common, so you'll memorize it eventually.

Unlike the English verb '"want", it does not have a strong connotation of 'need', Similarly, the Russian verb for "give"(да́ть) is totally OK for polite requests. Just use it with «пожа́луйста».

- *the person you give things **to** is NOT a direct object in Russian. It is called an indirect object and takes the Dative. We'll deal with it later.*

# Verbs in the Present 1

### Е- and И- conjugation

The verbs in Russian change according to person and number. Each form has a different ending. There are only two patterns (apart from some phonetic changes).

|             | endings                    | Е- / И- examples                       |
|:----------- |:-------------------------- |:-------------------------------------- |
| **я**       | -**ю** (у)                 | чита́ю, пишу́ / говорю́, ви́жу         |
| **ты**      | -**ешь** / -**ишь**        | чита́ешь, пи́шешь / говори́шь, ви́дишь |
| **он/она́** | -**ет** / -**ит**          | чита́ет, пи́шет / говори́т, ви́дит     |
|             |                            |                                        |
| **мы**      | -**ем** / -**им**          | чита́ем, пи́шем / говори́м, ви́дим     |
| **вы**      | -**ете** / -**ите**        | чита́ете, пи́шете / говори́те, ви́дите |
| **они́**    | -**ют**(ут) / -**ят** (ат) | чита́ют, пи́шут / говоря́т, ви́дят     |

We will learn these one by one. There are only **four** stems with completely irregular conjugation. The verbs хоте́ть, дать, есть, бежа́ть and all their derivatives follow neither the Е- nor the И-conjugation exactly.

Note that if the endings are stressed, Ё replaces Е. Fortunately, a non-past form has only 2 options:

- fixed stress – on the stem (чита́ю, чита́ете, ви́жу, ви́дит) or on the ending (стою́, стои́т, стои́шь)
- "я"-form has a stressed ending (Я пишу́). The stress falls on the stem everywhere else (ты пи́шешь, она пи́шет..)

*A verb uses one stem to form Infinitive and Past tense forms. It uses the 2nd one, similar, for the non-past forms and the imperative. So you cannot predict all forms from the infinitive. You can make a good guess, though.*

### Meals

In this course we use the American English definitions:

- **за́втрак** = *breakfast*, a morning meal
- **обе́д** = *lunch*, a midday meal
- **у́жин** = *dinner*, an evening meal

# The Infinitive, Likes and Dislikes

### I like/I love ?

In Russian, you can express liking things and activities pretty much the same way as in English, with similar verbs. The usage differs a bit, though.

A a rule of thumb, **«Я люблю́»** means *"I love"* only when directed at a single person (or animal). Otherwise, it's just "I like".

- "LOVE" **люби́ть** means a stable, lasting feeling (note the phonetic change for the 1st person singular: "люблю"). A normal, transitive verb, i.e. used with the Accusative. Use it for ***loving*** an individual or *liking some things/people/activity in general* (verbs take infinitive). Very much preferred in negations of such activities (i.e. "don't like to wait")
- "LIKE" **нра́виться** means moderate "liking" something or someone, often something specific. Not transitive! The thing liked is the subject, acting indirectly on a person: «Мне нра́вится стол» = *I like the table.*
- note that «Мне нра́вится стол» works in a similar way to the English verb "to appeal": *"This table appeals to me"*. The sentence is built as though the table "transmits" the feeling towards you. While rare in English, in Russian, this is pretty typical for feelings and experience to be expressed that way («Мне хорошо́»).

*The two forms* «нра́виться» *(infinitive) and* «нра́вится» *(3rd person singular) are pronounced exactly the same. They are spelled differently for the sake of consistency (most infinitives end in* «-ть»*, so* -ть + ся = -ться*)*

When you refer to generic things and activities, both verbs can be used but «люби́ть» is mildly more useful.

### May I?

Possibility and/or permission are often expressed with words **мо́жно** and **нельзя́**.

- Здесь мо́жно жить. = One may live here.
- Здесь нельзя́ есть. = One cannot/should not eat here.

The English translation may vary. You can specify the person for whom the permission or recommendation applies, in the Dative (but you do not have to):

- Мне нельзя́ спать. = I should not sleep.
- Нам нельзя́ мно́го есть. = We should not eat a lot.

P.S. the **-ся** at the end of "нра́вится" is a reflexive particle and comes after the ending (in verbs, use *-сь* after a vowel, *-ся* after a consonant) . Technically, a reflexive verb is one where the subject of the verb acts on itself. As you can see, the meaning does not always reflect this. «Нра́виться» is among the verbs that are reflexive "just because".

Don't worry about it too much for now. We'll be tackling reflexives in more detail further down the tree.

# Food

### Yummy

Some nouns, like "water" or "bread", are not normally used in the plural. They are called *uncountable* or *mass* nouns. Both English and Russian have them. Food offers a delicious intake of mass nouns!

- **карто́шка**(potatoes), **лук**(onions), **морко́вь** (carrots), **шокола́д** are mass nouns in Russian
- a reminder: mass nouns may use the Genitive instead of Accusative if you mean "some quantity"(e.g., Купи́ хле́ба/карто́шки. = Buy some bread/potatoes.

The preposition «для»(for) always takes Genitive nouns, just like «у» or «возле».

### 'Taters

The formal word for potato is **карто́фель** (German speakers, rejoice), but it's hardly ever used in speech. Use «карто́шка» instead.

The word for tomato is **помидо́р**. There is also the word **тома́т**, but it is

- the plant's name, pretty formal; look on price tags
- the base stem for derivative products: *тома́тная па́ста = tomato paste*
- **посуда** is a word for different containers used for cooking , consuming and further storage of food. English, sadly, does not have the exact equivalent. However, it is obviously "dishes" that you wash and "cookware/tableware" that you buy.

### Verbal wisdom

In this skill, we used *perfective* verbs for "cook", "cut", "wash". The reason is simple: that's the verb you'd use when you want a *single specific* action, often with a result—rather than referring to "activity" (activity may be fun but, in some cases, pointless).

More on that later. For now, just go with the flow.

# Adjectives Basics and Spelling

In Russian adjectives *agree* with the nouns they modify in gender/number and case. Out of 24 combinations only 12 forms are different. This system is completely regular, with no change of stress. The endings have “hard” and “soft” variants depending on the stem (for example, ый/ий or “ая/яя”).

**Here is the Nominative and Genitive** for “classic” hard- and soft-stem adjectives ("new"/"blue"):

|      | NOM                          | GEN                           |
|:---- |:---------------------------- |:----------------------------- |
| fem  | но́в**ая**/си́н**яя** чашка  | но́в**ой**/си́н**ей** ча̒шки  |
| masc | но́в**ый**/си́н**ий** дом    | но́в**ого**/си́н**его** до́ма |
| neut | но́в**ое**/си́н**ее** окно́  | но́в**ого**/си́н**его** окна  |
| pl.  | но́в**ые**/си́н**ие** ча́шки | но́в**ых**/си́н**их** ча́шек  |

note that *masculine* and *neuter* merge in all their forms different from the Nominative one (their Accusative will be the same as the Gen. or the Nom. depending on animacy). In the Nominative there is also -ОЙ masculine ending: **большо́й** (“big”). Only for ending-stressed adjectives.

- ОГО/ЕГО are historical spellings: **г** actually sounds like [**в**]
- unstressed -ая(яя) /-ое (ее) sound identical in standard Russian: *си́няя* and *си́нее* have no difference in pronunciation.

The following universal rules of Russian spelling will give you the rest of the endings for any adjective you ever meet (there exist 4 patterns at most):

- After **Г-К-Х** (“velars”) and **Ш-Щ-Ж-Ч** (“hushes”) use **И** and never *Ы*
- After **Ц , Г-К-Х** (“velars”) and **Ш-Щ-Ж-Ч** (“hushes”) use **А, У** and never *Я, Ю*
- After **Ц** and **Ш-Щ-Ж-Ч** (“hushes”) use **Е** *when unstressed* and never *О*.

# Conjunctions

### а vs. и

In Russian, **и** is used to show similarity. Otherwise you should use **а**, which shows *contrast*. To be more specific, here are the typical patterns:

- Я мальчик, а ты девочка. = I am a boy and you are a girl.
- Я работаю в кафе, а ты в школе. = I work in a cafe, and you (work) in a school.
- Я люблю спать, а ты нет. = I like sleeping, and you don't.
- А ты? = And you? → often used to indicate a question.

### зато (negative, зато positive)

A conjunction used for "compensating" for something unpleasant with something that, you imply, is good:

- У нас нет молока, зато есть хлеб = *We don't have milk but we do have bread*.
- Мальчик ещё не умеет писать, зато хорошо читает. = *The boy cannot write yet but he reads well*.

Not exactly the best thing to translate into English (*"on the other hand"? "but at least"? "thankfully?"*), so it is not often used in this course.

### хотя ('though')

Much like the English *though/even though/although*. It is often combined with "и" before the predicate (which is sometimes directly after «хотя»):

- Он здесь, хотя (он) и не знает ничего.= Он здесь, хотя (он) ничего и не знает. = He is here, even though he doesn't know anything.

### как

This conjunction has a rather interesting use, to show when someone perceives someone else's action:

- Я ви́жу, как она́ танцу́ет. = I see her dancing.
- Они́ слу́шают, как музыка́нт игра́ет. = They listen to the musician playing.

------

*For **а**, there is also "narrative" contrast pattern, largely absent from this course (but not from real-life Russian):*

- На столе чашка, а в чашке чай. = *There is a cup on the table, and the cup has tea in it*.
- Он здесь, а это значит — воды нет. = *He is here, and that means there's no water*.
- Такси — это машина, а машины не всегда хорошо работают. = *A taxi is a car, and cars do not always work well.* (here, you are making your point by introducing a new thought "unexpected" by a listener)

# There is

### Word order

To say "there is/are" in Russian, do the following:

- say THE PLACE
- then the verb (if any)
- then THE OBJECT

«есть» is not used, unless the sentence really has to emphasize the existence of the object. Some examples:

- На столе́ ло́жка. = There is a spoon on the table.
- На сту́ле ма́льчик. = There is a boy on the chair.
- В до́ме никого́ нет. = There is no one in the house.
- На столе́ лежи́т ко́шка. = A cat is lying on the table.

In the Present tense no verb is necessary; in the past, you would at least need a form of "to be". Note that even in the present Russian still uses verbs like "is situated", "stands", "lies" way more often than would be considered normal in English.

The most natural translation into English is a structure like "There is an apple on the table" or "An apple is on the table". The emphasis is on the object, not on the place.

*Actually, such a sentence answers the question of WHAT is in the said place. For out-of-the-blue sentences about objects that have nothing unique about them it matches what English THERE-IS sentences are for. So this is what we have in this course.*

### Actions

The initial position of a "place" inside the sentence holds for many other structures, too. Whenever the place is not a part of the "message" of your sentence, it is usually somewhere at the beginning (that is, if the place frames your description of an action rather than providing crucial information).

If the whole point of uttering a sentence is telling someone about the place then, naturally, it takes the sentence-final position:

- За́втра я в Нью-Йо́рке. = I am in New York tomorrow. (not somewhere else)

### lies/stands

You don't have to translate verbs like "to stand" and "to lie" literally when they refer to objects. Such use is not, by a wide margin, nearly as standard in English as it is in Russian:

- На столе́ стои́т ча́шка. = *A cup is ("stands") on the table.*

In English "to be" is perfectly fine, so we accept that.

# Questions

### Where

Russian makes a distinction between being somewhere (тут/здесь, там) , going there (сюда, туда) and coming *from* there (отсюда, оттуда)—so naturally question words follow suit:

- Где? = Where (at)?
- Куда? = Where to?
- Откуда? = Where from?

### Who or what are you?

Russian uses **«Кто»**(who) when asking about identity and occupation and «Что» is used for objects rather than people. Since Russian nouns have cases, **кто** and **что** also change depending on their role in the implied sentence. As you will discover a little bit further down the tree, «Кто» behaves rather like a masculine adjective.

| CASE | What  | Who   | Whose                       |
|:---- |:----- |:----- |:--------------------------- |
| Nom. | что   | кто   | чей, чьё, чья ,чьи          |
| Gen. | чего́ | кого́ | чьего́, чьего́, чье́й, чьих |
| Acc. | что   | кого  | Gen/Nom; «чью» for Fem.     |
| Prep | чём   | ком   | чьём, чьём, чьей, чьих      |

### Почему? and Зачем?

- **Почему** is used when asking a question about a cause of some event or action. It is a question that looks back at the past.
- **Зачем** starts a question about the **purpose** of some action or some event that can have one. It is a question that looks towards a desired future.

In a few regions of Russia (Tatarstan, for example) people may use *зачем* for both questions if their usage of Russian is influenced by a major local language that makes no distinction between the two. In Standard Russian these are two clearly separate entities.

# People 1

### Vocabulary

- **директор** is usually the main boss, akin to CEO in English. Also the Principal or Head Teacher of a school.
- **ученик** is a school student or a "follower" or "disciple" of some "teacher" in a more spiritual sense. AmE speakers may confuse it with "студент", which is strictly a college-level student.
- **коллега** is your first word of *common* gender, i.e. its gender depends on who you are referring to.

# Around you

### Do that the English way

To express the idea of speaking some language, or something being written in that language, Russian has adverbs literally meaning "Russian-ly", "English-ly" etc.. :

- Я не говорю́ по-ру́сски. = I do not speak Russian.
- Вы говори́те по-англи́йски. = Do you speak English?

They are formed from **-ский** adjectives by attaching **по-** and changing the tail to bare **-ски**: по-ру́сски, по-италья́нски, по-япо́нски, по-вьетна́мски, по-америка́нски, по-францу́зски and so on.

And remember, these words actually mean something done "in a certain way", so «суши по-американски» (American-style sushi) should not surprise you!

### Locative 2

A relatively small group of short masculine nouns have an accented **-у** ending with *в/на* in the meaning of place (and only then):

- Мы в **аэропорту́**. = We are at the airport.
- Я сплю́ на **полу́**. = I sleep on the floor.

Our course has about a dozen of them (there are about 100 in the language). Also, there exists a very small group of feminine nouns, all "-ь"-ending, that have a stressed Locative-2 ending:

- Твой сви́тер в **крови́**. = Your sweater is covered in blood.

All these nouns use their normal Prepositional form with "о" and "при".

### совсе́м

Совсем is used to show that a quality is "totally" present/not present— usually with negatives:

- Он совсе́м не рабо́тает. = He doesn't work at all.
- Том совсе́м не ест. = Tom doesn't eat at all.
- Мы совсе́м бли́зко. = We are really close (i.e. almost there).

### междунаро́дный

It comes from «ме́жду» + «наро́ды», i.e. "between"+"peoples", which is quite literally "international".

The loanword «интернациональный» means the same but has quite limited use in certain combinations like "international team" or "international debt" (mostly these are from political contexts). This course largely avoids this word.

Most likely, "international team/orchestra" etc. is the context where you must use «интернациональный»).

### живо́тное

The word for an "animal" is a nominalised neuter adjective, and its case forms follow an adjectival pattern. Of course, its gender is fixed:

- Это живо́тные. = These are animals.
- Я люблю́ живо́тных. = I like animals.

# Prepositions and Places

### Verbs of motion

Russian distinguishes between "going" on foot and by some sort of vehicle. If you aren't moving within the city, use a 'vehicle verb' **ехать** (one-way movement) or **ездить** (repeated, round trip or in general). More on that later, in "Motion verbs".

### Into/onto... at-to?

Once again, with **в** and **на** you use Prepositional for *location*, and Accusative for *direction*:

- Я живу́ в *Ло́ндоне*. ~ I live in London.
- Я е́ду в *Ло́ндон*. ~ I am going (by vehicle) to London.

Here is a 'cheat sheet' of forms you'll need for places (no living beings, so—the easy Accusative for masculine):

| Nominative    | Acc.    | Prep. | example                       |
|:------------- |:------- |:----- |:----------------------------- |
| -а/-я         | -у/-ю   | -е    | Америка → в Америку/в Америке |
| ∅/-о/-е       | ∅/-о/-е | -е    | стол → на стол / на столе     |
| -ь *feminine* | -ь      | -и    | дверь → на дверь/на двери     |
| **-ия**       | -ию     | -ии   | Англия → в Англию/в Англии    |
| **-ие**       | -ие     | -ии   | здание → в здание / в здании  |

### Word choice

For "outdoors" Russians use **«на улице»** (literally, "on the street").

The preposition **о** (об) means "about" only as in the sense of "thinking/writing about". Don't use it for "approximately". With «*мне*» a special form is used, **обо**.

The contraction "USA" or "the U.S." is **США** (сэ-шэ-А, with the stress on the last vowel).

There is no difference drawn between "city" and "town".

In Russian it is typical to describe objects as "standing", "lying", "being situated", "hanging". This is rare in English, and often sounds unnatural, therefore in this course it is perfectly OK to translate a "whereabouts"-verb with a simple "is", "was" etc.

### Here and there, and here

For "here", the words **здесь** and **тут** are almost completely interchangeable in any imaginable context. **Тут** is considered a bit more informal, and is used in set expressions ( тут же~right away, тут и там). «Здесь» is somewhat less suitable for figurative meanings (when by "here" you mean the current situation rather than a place). In this course, they are completely interchangeable when not being used in a set expression.

**находиться** is a verb to denote the whereabouts of things, and, sometimes of people (when the emphasis is on exactly where they are). It could be translated as "to be situated" or "to be located", but as these verbs usually sound rather formal in English, so you can just use "to be".

**около** is almost the same as «возле». It can also be used in the sense of "about"(=approximately).

# Verbs Present 2

### → and ⇆

There are two options for verbs of **going**: a specific 1-directional verb and also a repeated motion, multi-directional verb. For now, stick to this rule for **идти́ / ходи́ть**:

|                | ENG                                                | RUS                                   |
|:-------------- |:-------------------------------------------------- |:------------------------------------- |
| **right now**→ | I *am going*.                                      | Я **иду́**.→                          |
| *habitual* ⇆   | I often *go* there.                                | Я ча́сто туда́ **хожу́**.             |
| *generic* ↝↶↺  | The baby already *walks*. I *am walking* (around). | Ребёнок уже́ **хо́дит**. Я **хожу́**. |

### Asking

- **проси́ть** → to ask for/beg for/request something
- **спра́шивать** → to ask a question (i.e. ask for information)

In other words, when using **про́сит**, one wants to be given something (or for something to be done). He who **спра́шивает** wants an answer.

By the way, "to ask a question" is, actually, «зада́ть/задава́ть вопро́с». Those who speak German may recall *eine Frage stellen*, which works in a similar way (apparently, "to ask an asking" is no good in German, either).

### Negative sentences

Remember that Russian sort of uses double and triple negatives. To be more precise, it is coordinated negation: when the sentence is negative, you should automatically negate every pronoun referring to *someone*, *anywhere*, *some time*, *anything*, *in some way* and so on:

- Мы никогда́ нику́да ни с кем не ходи́м = We never go anywhere with anyone (Literally, "We never to nowhere with nobody don't go").

All such words should change to *nobody, nowhere, never, nothing, by no means* and so on. *No one* and *nothing* will have the correct case.

### Adverbs

The typical position for **-о**(-е)-ending adverbs is *before* the verb. For example:

- «Он хорошо́ види́т»="He sees well".
- «Том бы́стро ушёл»="Tom left quickly"

### Consonant mutation.

You might have noticed that the consonant before the ending is sometimes different in the infinitive than in the personal forms. It is called *mutation* and is quite similar to the process that makes "tense" into "tension" (where an "s" turns into a "sh"). Here are the patterns you might encounter:

- Б, П, В, Ф, М adding **л** (люби́ть / люблю́)
- С, Х becoming **ш** (писа́ть / пишу́)
- Д, З becoming **ж** (ви́деть / ви́жу)
- Т, К becoming **ч** (плати́ть / плачу́)
- СК, СТ becoming Щ (пусти́ть / пущу́)

If there is alteration, there is a rule:

- **И-conjugation verbs** only have 1st person singular mutated. It is normal (e.g. люблю / любит)
- **Е-conjugation verbs** have mutation in ALL personal forms (if at all). It is *non-productive behavior*, which in practice means that a lot of popular verb stems still have it (e.g. писать, сказать). However, new Е-conjugation verbs never get this pattern.

рисовать → рисую, *on the other hand, is a regular transformation of* -овать/-евать *verbs*

### Playing

The verb «играть» is used as follows:

- **в** + Accusative for games
- **на** + Prepositional for musical instruments

For example, Я игра́ю в футбо́л / Я игра́ю на гита́ре.

# Time and Numbers

### Using numbers with nouns

Let's focus on the Nominative for now (this also works when Acc.=Nom). Russian numbers may seem a bit weird. The case of the noun depends on the last word of the number:

| last word                      | means              | Case     | example                                                              |
|:------------------------------ |:------------------ |:-------- |:-------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| оди́н *(одна́, одно́, одни́ )* | 1                  | Nom. sg. | оди́н дом, одна́ ма́ма, два́дцать одно́ окно́, оди́н сто́л           |
| два *(две)*, три, четы́ре      | 2, 3, 4            | Gen. sg. | две ко́шки, два стола́, три ма́льчика, три́дцать четы́ре стола́      |
| Larger than that               | 5, 6, 12, 100 etc. | Gen. pl. | пять ко́шек, пять ма́льчиков, два́дцать пять ко́шек, миллио́н ко́шек |

Just like English, Russian has words for *eleven through nineteen*, so they fall into the "larger" category.

**Genitive plural** has a rather bizarre set of patterns, so a separate skill later on will teach you how to make it for most nouns.

### Expressions

- *I am 10 (years old)* = Мне де́сять (лет) Note the Dative "мне" and the number in the Nominative. The Genitive plural "лет" is irregular.

The Dative forms of он, она and они are ему, ей, им respectively.

- *at 9 o'clock* = в де́вять часо́в → the Accusative here (same as the Nominative)
- *at 2 in the morning* = в два (часа́) но́чи (in Russian 'morning' starts at about 4-5 a.m.)
- *in January, June. etc.* = в январе́, ию́не ... (Prepositional). Note that all the month names are masculine nouns.
- the beginning/end of July = нача́ло/коне́ц ию́ля

------

Why are Russian numbers so strange? Well, for 2-3-4 these are the remnants of the Dual number (which is between the singular and the plural). As for the larger numbers, they are essentially "nouns": *a heap of cats, a lot of cats, a thousand... of cats*.

### Сейчас

Russian uses two words for "now". One is «сейчас», which means "now, at the moment", and describes the current moment in a neutral manner, often implying that things change and the state described is attributed to this particular moment. It can change soon:

- Сейчас никого нет дома. = No one is home (right) now.
- Сейчас пять утра. = It is 5 a.m. now.

Теперь is the "now" you use when things are different from "before". You imply that the situation has changed. It is also associated with a more prolonged period of time, i.e. the state of affairs is different from before, and will stay so for now:

- Мы теперь работаем в главном офисе. = We now work at the main office. *(We did not, but now we are, and things are going to stay like that for some time)*

### время

The noun «время» ("time") belongs to a really small class of neuter nouns. Its Genitive form is времени, and all other oblique forms also retain the -ен part.

# Family

Not much to say here, except that Russian does not have a special word for *siblings* or *grandparents*.

Unlike English, Russians rarely say "my mother", "my grandfather"; usually they omit "my".

### свой ~ one's own

...And when they don't, it is more natural to use reflexive "свой" (one's own). English does not have anything quite like that. Essentially, it is a substitute for *my, your, his, her* etc. that you use when it refers to the person (or thing) that is the subject of the sentence or, at least, the clause you are in. A few typical examples:

- Кошка ест из *своей* миски = The cat is eating out of *its* bowl.
- Мы у *(своих)* родителей = We are at *our* parents' place. (here you can omit "своих")
- Я думаю, он у *своих* родителей = I think he's at *his* parents' place.

Forms of «свой» follow the same mostly-adjectival pattern that «мой»,«твой», «ваш», «наш» and «этот» use: свой, своя, своё, свои → своего, свою, своих...

Since «свой» describes something belonging to the subject of the sentence, it cannot be used with the subject of the sentence itself. The exception is made when you are making generalisations, e.g. "One's (own) reputation is always more important"~«Своя репутация всегда важнее».

Pay attention to what the *grammatical subject* is. Sentences like «Мне нравится у своей сестры» are sort-of-OK sometimes, but you are really treading on thin ice here. This one sounds almost normal, while some others would immediately look unnatural.

### Mister!

In spoken Russian «дядя»(uncle) and «тётя»(aunt) are often used to refer to some adult "guy" or "woman". A special case is children's use, since they often use it even as a form of address ("тётя Маша!").

This course doesn't cover this. But it's still useful to know.

# People 2

### A student

Russian has different words for a school student (aka *a pupil*, BrE) and a college-level student, which both have masculine and feminine versions:

- **учени́к / учени́ца** – a school student or a student/apprentice in general, especially in spiritual sense
- **студе́нт / студе́нтка** – a college or university-level student (attends a corresponding institution)

**Молоде́ц** is a word you use when someone "did a good job". It comes with a patronizing shade, so ideally you use it towards your friends or actual students/ subordinates (but not towards people whose work you are in no position to judge).

### 5 men

When you are counting people, use "челове́к" for numbers that end in «пять» (5) or more. Anywhere else use the normal Genitive plural "люде́й" (with *много* and *мало* both are possible, but I'd stick to *люде́й*).

### Learning and studying

Russian has a number of ways to express learning, but in this course we have **учи́ться**, **учи́ть**, and **занима́ться**. The 1st verb, **учи́ться**, is introduced in this skill. Here is a little more information:

|                            | meaning                                                   | examples                                  |
|:-------------------------- |:--------------------------------------------------------- |:----------------------------------------- |
| **учи́ться**               | to study (e.g. to attend classes or to do self-study)     | Днём я учу́сь.                            |
| **учи́ться в**(на) + Prep. | to study somewhere; to be in *nth* grade/*nth* year       | Де́вочка у́чится в шко́ле, в 3-м кла́ссе. |
| учи́ть + Acc.*subject*     | to learn, to memorize something («наизу́сть» ="by heart") | Я учу́ слова́. Я учу́ ру́сский язы́к.     |
| учи́ть + Acc + Dat         | to teach somebody something                               | Я учу́ студе́нтов ру́сскому.              |

### Doctor

The usual word for a (medical) doctor is «**врач**». We also have «до́ктор», which is fine but informal. However, a "doctor" as a person with a corresponding degree is «до́ктор» (no alternatives).

# Weather and Nature

### It's raining

"To go" is the verb used for precipitation in Russian:

- Идёт дождь = It is raining.
- Идёт снег. = It is snowing.
- Идёт град. = it is hailing *(we don't have it in the course)*.

### in summer/winter

Russian has adverbs for "in spring", "in summer" etc. They are formed as the *Instrumental* case of a corresponding noun.

We'll cover the Instrumental in detail later. Right now just get used to the words themselves:

- Весно́й мо́кро. = It's wet in spring
- Зимо́й хорошо́ = It's good/nice in winter.
- О́сенью гря́зно. = It's muddy in the fall.
- Ле́том со́лнечно. = It is sunny in summer.

*Russians usually assign each season 3 months, i.e. winter is December through February and spring is March through May (even if you have snow well into April).*

### Category of State

It is easier than it sounds. When expressing a "state", some modality, or one's opinion on the situation, Russian often uses these *impersonal* words, saying that such and such state is observed:

- Мне **хо́лодно**. = I'm (feeling) cold.
- На у́лице **тепло́**. = It is warm outside.
- **Хорошо́**, что вы тут. = It is good you are here.
- **Тру́дно** сказа́ть. = It is hard to say.

Many are homonymous with adverbs and short-form adjectives. So we'll study them later with adjectives. For now, we only have a handful of such words useful when discussing the weather.

Needless to say, these do not use any grammatical subject and are quite useful with verbs like "to be" and "to become" ("It's getting warmer").

# Sport

### win/lose

Here you encounter two *perfective* verbs; these two very obviously refer to a specific result:

- Ты проигра́л! = You lost!
- Нам надо вы́играть. = We need to win.

Note the formation of the past. If you remember *был, была́*—all Russian past forms are essentially formed the same way. The endings correspond to gender and number:

| **masc** | **fem** | **neut** | **pl** |
|:-------- |:------- |:-------- |:------ |
| —        | **-а**  | **-о**   | **-и** |

We'll be practising many more past forms in the skill in the next row.

### Reflexive

As a reminder, if a verb has **-ся** at the end, you add it after the usual ending («-сь» is used after a vowel):

- ката́ться на лы́жах = to ski
- Я ката́юсь на лы́жах = I ski.

### «бежа́ть», to run

In this skill, we introduce the one-way verb "to run". You may not remember but it has one of the four irregular stems:

| SING.       | PLUR.          |
|:----------- |:-------------- |
| Я **бегу́** | Мы бежи́м      |
| Ты бежи́шь  | Вы бежи́те     |
| Он бежи́т   | Они **бегу́т** |

# Adjectives 1

In Russian the adjective *agrees* with the noun it modifies in gender(number) and case. Fortunately, the system is *completely* regular and the stress stays the same. The forms for the cases you know are:

| **ENDINGS** | masculine        | neuter      | feminine    |
|:----------- |:---------------- |:----------- |:----------- |
| Nom.        | **-ый(о́й)/-ий** | **-ое/-ее** | **-ая/-яя** |
| Acc.        | Nom. or Gen.     | -ое/-ее     | -ую/-юю     |
| Gen.        | -ого/-его        | see masc.   | -ой/-ей     |
| Prep.       | -ом/-ем          | see masc.   | -ой/-ей     |

The plural ending in the Nominative is **-ые (ие)**. We will address the oblique forms later in the course.

A few examples:

- Я живу в большом городе. (Prep.,masc.)
- Дайте большого кота. (Acc.,masc.)
- Нам надо найти хорошую книгу. (Acc.,fem)

### velars and hushes

Adjectives with the stem on **-к, -г, -х, -ш, -щ, -ж, -ч** will use "и", "а", "у" instead of "ы", "я", "ю" so watch carefully ("русский", for instance).

We will tackle the endings one at a time.

### целый vs. весь

In Russian the idea of "the whole" of something can be expressed by either «целый» or «весь». The former is used when implying the unexpectedly "large" amount; it is the one we're teaching in this skill:

- Он целый день спит. (normally, a person should have been awake for a long time)

# Past & Infinitive

### The infinitive stem

In Russian the Past tense and the Infinitive are formed from the same stem.

The forms are actually much easier than in the Present because there are only four forms in total for *masculine/feminine/neuter + plural*, similar to adjectives (the forms were participles once).

| VERB       | **masc** | **fem** | **neut** | **pl** |
|:---------- |:-------- |:------- |:-------- |:------ |
| **ending** | —        | **-а**  | **-о**   | **-и** |
| быть       | был      | была́   | бы́ло    | бы́ли  |
| есть       | ел       | е́ла    | е́ло     | е́ли   |

«идти» and all its derivatives (пойти́, прийти́, найти́..) has a strange, irregular past stem:

**walked, went**: он пошёл, она пошл**а́**, оно пошл**о́**, они пошл**и́**

For the masculine form, there is a phonetic simplification for verbs with infinitives in *-чь,-сти/-зти, -зть/-сть*. For example “мочь”(“can”), “ползти́”(crawl) and “лезть”(climb): *он **мог, полз, лез*** — no final **Л** here.

This skill mostly covers the past form of imperfective verbs (only «уста́ть» and «подожда́ть» are perfective). What it means for you is that when 2 or more such actions are mentioned, they all happened at the same time or in no particular order. Why? Imperfective verbs like «идти́», «жить», «говори́ть» are by nature unspecific about their exact time frame.

- they express repeated or prolonged action
- they express action in progress
- they can also express the fact that an action has or has not occured (with or without details on "when" it took place).

### What about the present form?

For some verb types the two stems are nearly identical (понима́ть, говори́ть). Which is a good thing for you!

# Shopping

### Give me that!

By now, you have probably noticed a surprising lack of "that one" in Russian. Russian mostly uses "этот" both for "this" and "that", unless you need to make a contrast between "this one here" and "that one there".

However, when you are really pointing at things, use whatever you like!

- «вот тут»~right here;«вот э́тот» ~ "this one here"
- «вон там»~over there; «вон тот» ~ "that one over there"

("вот" is acceptable with both)

### Clothing

- **оде́жда** is a mass noun for "clothes", **о́бувь** for footwear.
- **ту́фли** are also "shoes", but a more specific kind: "dress shoes" or the shoes you'd use with a gown
- **боти́нок** ...a dictionary will say it's a bit higher than a "dress shoe". In reality, especially in men's speech, the word is often used for shoes, too
- **сапо́г** is most definitely a boot
- **пальто́** is typically a long outer garment
- **ку́ртка** is more generic but usually refers to a shorter outer garment—with proportions not much different from a shirt
- **руба́шка** is the word used for shirt. «Соро́чка» is a formal word for a shirt that is worn as a part of a suit (eg. with pants, a jacket and a necktie), but people still use "руба́шка" anyway.

### a bigger/smaller shirt

From the **Adjectives** skill you might remember «бо́льше» and «меньше» as words for "more/bigger" and "less/fewer/smaller". Since these work as adverbs, it is problematic to use them with nouns.

Instead, the words **«побо́льше» / «поме́ньше»** are used AFTER a noun:

- Я хочу́ стол побо́льше/поме́ньше.
- Да́йте я́блоко побо́льше.

This works with some other popular adjectives: подлинне́е, покоро́че, полу́чше. When not used with nouns directly, these have a colloquial quality.

Actually, with adjectives other than *большо́й/мале́нький* you may resort to «бо́лее дли́нное пальто́». However, «бо́лее большо́е» is not used.

# Dative and Plurals

### The Dative Case in Russian

You have already seen that many **expressions of feelings and experience** use the Dative: *”Мне нра́вится...”, “Ма́ме хорошо́”, “Ему́ 5 лет”, “Мне ка́жется ...”* etc.

The Dative introduces an ***indirect object*** of an action: usually the person whom the action is directed towards. An example would be a sentence like “I handed a package to *my mom*”: “my mom” here is a recipient.

Actually, this depends on the verb, just like in English. Some popular verbs of speech, writing or “giving” will use the bare Dative for the recipient: ***говори́ть, сказа́ть, писа́ть, чита́ть, дать, принести́*** and so on.

### Dative prepositions

- **по**: the basic meaning is “movement along the surface”("covering" it) which may realize as “walking around the park”, “running down the street”, “looking for it all over the house” etc.
- **к**: towards, to. Often used when you are going towards somebody (“towards Anna” = «к Анне»)
- several bookish prepositional phrases like «благодаря́» (thanks to) or «вопреки́» (contrary to)

**По** has an additional meaning, “apiece” or "each" : «Они́ взя́ли по три я́блока»=”They took 3 apples each”.

*There is a bookish use of* «по» *meaning "upon". It goes with Prepositional, and is mostly used in set prepositional phrases like* «по оконча́нии» *(upon completion).*

### Cases in plural

Plurals generally have only **one pattern** shared by all nouns. The ending only depends on the case, not the class of a noun:, «я говорю́ о дома́х, стра́нах, города́х, я́блоках, дочеря́х».

Only the Nominative and (especially) the Genitive have a number of different plural endings that depend on the class of a noun.

# Speaking 1

### Sequence of tenses in Russian

There is no sequence of tenses in Russian whatsoever.

The information in a subordinate sentence is understood to be relative to the main clause:

- Он сказа́л, что не зна́ет. = *He said he didn't know.*

So if the piece of information is simply about where things are or what someone does, use present tense in the subordinate clause.

### ли

Use the particle "ли" in reported questions or situations when you don't know which option is true:

- Я спроси́л, зна́ет ли он Москву́. = *I asked him if he knew Moscow*.
- Мы не зна́ем, бу́дет ли он в о́фисе. = *We don't know whether he is going to show up in the office*.

The particle is attached to the word that is in doubt. It needn't be a verb, for instance, «Я не зна́ю, в Москве́ ли он» (i.e. whether he is in Moscow or in some other city). «Ли» generally attaches to the first stressed word of the clause.

### Talk or say?

The verb *говори́ть* is used both as "to say, to tell" and as "to talk, to speak". When you report someone's words, it is the 1st meaning:

- Она говори́т, что хо́чет спать. = She says that she wants to sleep.

Russian has a whole set of **perfective** verbs. Usually you arrange verbs neatly into closely matching pairs of *imperfective + perfective*. And these are different for the two meanings of «говори́ть»:

- to say → говори́ть / сказ́ать
- to speak → говори́ть / поговори́ть

Remember «Скажи́те, пожа́луйста ... » ?

Rather than referring to ongoing actions or past(future) actions in general, perfective verbs refer to actions in a point-wise manner, ignoring the action's inner structure. That is, such "singular" actions happen at some particular "moment" and can be conveniently arranged in a sequence when telling a story. This distinction is about to come into focus in one of the following skills.

# Perfective Verbs -1

### Aspect in Russian

Verbs in Russian come in two 'flavors' : *perfective* (eg. “пригото́вить”) and *imperfective* (eg. “гото́вить”).

Let's get this straight right away: most perfectives are made by attaching a prefix—and the endings of the resulting verb change in the same way they changed for the source verb.

**Perfective** verbs express an action, an "event" linked to a point in time. Sometimes they assert the presence of a result. You use them for sequences of actions, too.

**Imperfective** verbs are used for everything else: processes, states, repeated actions and for generic reference to an action (when the time of occurrence is irrelevant).

In this introductory lesson we deal with the most basic pattern of use:

- **perfective verbs** are used to tell stories about **successive** actions
- imperfectives are used for *simultaneous* processes
- **perfective verbs** are often used to describe *single* actions that have a specific result, e.g., “Give me that”, “I bought some food”, “I have painted many pictures”. However, not all of them can be reliably described like that.
- we use imperfective to tell that someone has or has never done something, especially in "out of the blue" situations. When the action was *supposed* to be done (which is known by the listener), we use the perfective.

### Morphology

Being too lazy to make up many different verbs, we usually make new ones based on the old ones. The vast majority of unprefixed verbs are imperfective.

- **Prefixation** is the main method to create a perfective verb: писа́ть→написа́ть, идти́→пойти́.
- a different **suffix** is sometimes used: опа́здывать←опозда́ть
- occasionally, the **stress** changes: нареза́ть→наре́зать
- **different stems** are used for a few verbs: говори́ть→сказа́ть

The last phenomenon is known as *suppletion* and only happens for a limited number of verbs and their derivatives. The English verb "to go" is another example of such behavior (its past form is "went").

Note that suffixation is very popular for *secondary* imperfectives. Usually only one prefixed verb is considered an "ideal match" for an imperfective verb. Others are somewhat different in meaning (or a lot different). But you need imperfective partners for these, too, so Russian uses suffixes for that:

- чита́ть = to read (imperf.)
- перечита́ть = to reread (perf.) → *cannot be considered a "natural" perfective for this verb*
- перечи́тывать = to reread (imperf.)

### can

The verb «мочь» is used to talk about the general possibility of something, and also, very often—about your ability to perform something and reach some result. Perfectives are used in this second meaning:

- Я могу́ написа́ть кни́гу за ме́сяц = I can write a book in a month.
- Она́ мо́жет посмотре́ть? = Can she take a look?

We do not use мочь for skills. Russian has **уметь** for this.

### опять / снова

Both mean "again" and are largely interchangeable when they mean that an action from the past has occurred again.

«Опять» is more popular but it's focused on staying "the same as before". «Снова» (cf. «новый») can also mean action performed "anew, from the beginning".

Only «опять» is used in «опять же» (~"besides").

When asking someone to repeat, use «ещё раз».

### What else is there to it?

**imperfective verbs**

- name the action as a whole (“I can *swim*”)
- describe prolonged ***states*** and ***processes***, regular actions

**Perfective verbs** describe **events**: singular, definite actions that are viewed as localized in time. They “happened” at some moment (“I made a video”, “I slept for some time and then went outside”). Or they describe a certain change of state at some "turning point" (not yet eaten→eaten, not slept enough→slept enough and ready to get up).

It is argued in a few works that "a natural" perfective is just a prefixed verb where a prefix's metaphorical meaning so conveniently overlaps the verb's own meaning, that you cannot feel any change. So don't be surprised if some vague actions have several perfective matches for a single imperfective verb.

That also means that sometimes you'd better memorize a pair even if it is technically a "poor" match. After all, in some contexts it will come in handy:

- есть → съе́сть (to consume something, completely)
- есть → пое́сть (to have a meal, to spend some time eating—regardless of whether you finish your meal or decide you've had enough half-way)

# Instrumental Case

### Fortunately, this is the very last case!

It is used for some very specific meanings, that’s why we've put off covering it for so long.

- It is used alone for a “tool” or an “agent” of an action. English mostly uses “with” or “by” instead: “молотк**ом**” (with a hammer), ”ветр**ом**” (by wind), “сил**ой**” (by force)
- It is used alone with some verbs of “being”, “becoming”, “seeming”: *Я стал учител**ем*** ~ “I have become a teacher”

It is also used with prepositions:

- **с (со)** = “with” (together with someone/something) — note that “Я с ней” or even “Мы с ней” is the most natural way of saying “She and I”
- **за**/ **перед** — behind/ in front of
- **над**/ **под** — above/under
- **между** — between (also used with Genitive)

### Мы с тобой

When you tell someone about "you and I" or "my friend and I" etc., it is most idiomatic to use **мы с** + your companion in Instrumental.

- Мы с тобой друзья. = You and I are friends.
- Мы с мамой вчера купили компьютер. = Mom and I bought a computer yesterday.

Of course, when translating sentences out of the blue, you cannot (strictly speaking) tell if a speaker means "I" or "we". This is rarely a source of confusion in real situations (where it is unlikely a speaker goes on randomly switching between "I" and "we").

Sometimes you can interpret a joint action using "and" or "with", whatever sounds more natural:

- Мы с ними вчера не говорили. = They and I didn't talk yesterday / I didn't talk with (to) them yesterday.

### But wait, there's more!

Actually, Russian also has a handful of inconsistent cases that only exist for some words. They are (mostly) beyond the scope of this course:

- ***the Locative-2:*** the most important. Why? Because it's obligatory with the nouns that it applies to. It expresses the meaning of place, with *в*, *на* or both. It exists for over a hundred masculine nouns: в год**у**, на мост**у**, в лес**у**, на пол**у**. And for about 20 feminine nouns in —**ь**: в кров**и** (the ending is always stressed for both!)
- ***the Neo-vocative:*** a form of a name used when addressing a person. It exists for common names and several nouns: ***Вань! Вер! Алён! Мам! Пап!*** (just the last vowel sound is removed). The Historical vocative ("человек → человече") has been lost in modern Russian.
- ***the Genitive-2:*** for “some amount of a substance”. Increasingly replaced by the usual Genitive but still can be used for several masculine nouns: “Хочу ча**ю**”
- ***“Waiting” case:*** not much of a case, but actually the verb “ждать” (to wait) would use Accusative for people and things that can affect their appearance and Genitive for everything else (an event/thing that does not choose when to arrive).

# Body, Life and Death

### You have big eyes

Be careful NOT to use «есть» when describing properties of body parts, if their existence is normal and unlikely to surprise anyone:

- У меня длинный нос = *I have a long nose*.

### A Handy thing to know

The Russian words for limbs and what they have on the end of them can be a little confusing initially. Depending on the situation, рука can mean hand or it can mean arm. The same is true for нога; it can be foot or leg. Most of the time the meaning is clear from the context.

The difference works as follows:

- in English "hand", strictly speaking, means the part starting at the wrist.
- in Russian «рука», strictly speaking, means the whole arm.
- when you need a word describing the limb *functionally* (as something we use to work, to grab things etc.), English uses "hand" while Russian uses "arm".

The same goes for the lower limb.
