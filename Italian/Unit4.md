# Verbs: Future Perfect

The **future perfect** in Italian is formed using the future tense of “avere” (avrò, avrai, avrà, etc.) or “essere” (sarò, sarai, sarà, etc.) followed by the past participle of the verb (-ato, -uto, -ito). Agreement for the participles and the use of “avere” or “essere” follows the same rules as the present perfect (passato prossimo) and all other perfect tenses.

Though the Italian future perfect can be translated as the future perfect in English (for example, “will have played”), there are a couple of unique uses of the future perfect in Italian.

One of these is the **conjectural future tense**. In Italian, the future and future perfect are used to express a conjecture about something in the present or the past, respectively. For statements, this can often be translated as “must” (in the future) or “must have” (in the future perfect):

Marta **avrà voluto** un gatto. = Marta **must have wanted** a cat.

For questions, one can express conjecture in English with “could,” “can,” “might,” etc.:

Chi **l’avrà preso**? = Who **can have taken** it?

You may also note that Italian uses the future or future perfect in some adverbial clauses (after “quando,” for example) referring to an action in the future, where English prefers the present or present perfect. For example:

Quando **avrò finito** i compiti, ti chiamerò. = When I **have finished** my homework, I will call you.

# Verbs: Subjunctive Present

The **subjunctive** is a grammatical mood used to express *doubt*, *emotion*, *wishes*, *orders*, or *opinions*. In other words, it doesn't refer to facts or actual events, but to feelings or situations that are uncertain or simply not yet verifiable. Mastering the subjunctive is a great way to impress native speakers with your Italian, mostly because even native speakers get it wrong sometimes! Don't worry though, it's only a matter of getting used to it.

This mood can be found in English as well (*that you be... if I were...*), and in Italian it's often introduced by the conjunction **che** (*that* ), but not necessarily. Here are some examples:

- *È importante **che tu sia** onesto.* = It's important that you be honest. [opinion/order]
- *Penso **che tu sia** il migliore.* = I think (that) you're the best. [opinion]
- *Sono contento **che tu abbia** un nuovo hobby.* = I'm glad (that) you have a new hobby. [emotion]
- *Voglio **che tu** mi **faccia** un favore.* = I want you to do me a favor. [wish]
- *Vogliono **che io dica** qualcosa.* = They want me to say something. [wish]
- *Dubito **che lei voglia** vedermi.* = I doubt (that) she wants to see me. [doubt]
- *È impossibile **che** la squadra **perda** due volte.* = It's impossible for the team to lose twice. [uncertainty - nobody can predict the future!]

Also, the conjunctions **nonostante**, **sebbene**, **malgrado** and **benché** (= even though) *always* trigger the subjunctive. Many native speakers often ignore this rule, but still...

- *Nonostante (io) **faccia** sempre del mio meglio, non è mai abbastanza.* = Even though I always do my best, it's never enough.
- *Nonostante (io) **faccia** sempre del mio meglio, sembra **che non sia** mai abbastanza.* = Even though I always do my best, it seems like it's never enough.

Finally, regular verbs follow this pattern:

|                   | **-ARE**  | **-ERE**  | **-IRE**         |
|:----------------- |:--------- |:--------- |:---------------- |
| **io**            | **-i**    | **-a**    | **-a/-isca**     |
| **tu**            | **-i**    | **-a**    | **-a/-isca**     |
| **lui, lei, Lei** | **-i**    | **-a**    | **-a/-isca**     |
| **noi**           | **-iamo** | **-iamo** | **-iamo**        |
| **voi**           | **-iate** | **-iate** | **-iate**        |
| **loro**          | **-ino**  | **-ano**  | **-ano/-iscano** |

|                         | **PARLARE**  | **VEDERE**  | **PARTIRE**  | **CAPIRE**    |
|:----------------------- |:------------ |:----------- |:------------ |:------------- |
| **(che) io**            | parl**i**    | ved**a**    | part**a**    | cap**isca**   |
| **(che) tu**            | parl**i**    | ved**a**    | part**a**    | cap**isca**   |
| **(che) lui, lei, Lei** | parl**i**    | ved**a**    | part**a**    | cap**isca**   |
| **(che) noi**           | parl**iamo** | ved**iamo** | part**iamo** | cap**iamo**   |
| **(che) voi**           | parl**iate** | ved**iate** | part**iate** | cap**iate**   |
| **(che) loro**          | parl**ino**  | ved**ano**  | part**ano**  | cap**iscano** |

# Verbs: Conditional

The **conditional** is another grammatical mood, and simply put, it's the Italian equivalent of the English verbs *would, could, might* and *should*.

- Lo **farei** solo per te. = *I **would do** it only for you.*
- Lei **potrebbe leggere** un libro. = *She **could/might read** a book.*
- Tu **dovresti essere** qui. = *You **should be** here.*

So, in Italian instead of *could* and *might* you use the conditional of the verb **potere** (*can, to be able to* ), instead of *should* you use the conditional of **dovere** (*must* ), and instead of *would*... you just use the conditional, because there's no need for an additional verb.

The **conditional** is formed by taking the root of the *future tense*, and adding these endings:

|               | AMARE          | VEDERE         | CAPIRE          |
|:------------- |:-------------- |:-------------- |:--------------- |
| io            | amer**ei**     | vedr**ei**     | capir**ei**     |
| tu            | amer**esti**   | vedr**esti**   | capir**esti**   |
| lui, lei, Lei | amer**ebbe**   | vedr**ebbe**   | capir**ebbe**   |
| noi           | amer**emmo**   | vedr**emmo**   | capir**emmo**   |
| voi           | amer**este**   | vedr**este**   | capir**este**   |
| essi          | amer**ebbero** | vedr**ebbero** | capir**ebbero** |

# Verbs: Conditional Perfect

The **conditional perfect** is formed using the present conditional form of **avere** or **essere** and the past participle. It follows the same rules as the other perfect tenses (present perfect, past perfect, etc.) to determine whether to use "avere" or "essere" and the gender and number of the participle.

The conditional perfect can often be used in the same way as the conditional perfect in English ("would have *__*").

One exception is that in Italian the conditional perfect is preferred when talking about the future from the point of view of the past, where English prefers the present conditional ("would *__*"). For example, for a sentence like, "You said you **would arrive** at seven," a good translation would be, "Hai detto che **saresti arrivato** alle sette" (literally "you would have arrived").

# Verbs: Subjunctive Imperfect

The **imperfect subjunctive** is used in similar situations to the present subjunctive (wishes, hopes, emotions, doubts, orders, etc.), but is set off by a verb in the past.

When preceded by a *past tense* verb, the imperfect subjunctive indicates an action occurring at the **same time** or **after** the main verb.

- Volevo che **fosse** vero. *I wanted it to be true.*
- Non credevamo che Anna **avesse** paura. *We didn't believe that Anna was afraid.*

Occasionally you will see the imperfect subjunctive following a *present* tense verb to show an action occurring **before** the main verb:

- Non credo che ci **fosse**. *I don't think he was there.*

Another use of the imperfect subjunctive is in **"if" statements**. You use the imperfect subjunctive after **se** when referring to a hypothetical situation. Sometimes these are called "contrary-to-fact" statements, because they describe something different from reality. In these cases, the imperfect subjunctive is paired with the conditional.

- Se **fossi** miliardaria, comprerei un castello. *If I were a billionaire, I would buy a castle.*
- Se i cani **parlassero**, cosa direbbero di noi? *If dogs talked, what would they say about us?*

We may notice that in English we also use a past tense for these hypothetical statements. We just have to remember to use the past *subjunctive* in Italian.

|                   | **-ARE**    | **-ERE**    | **-IRE**    |
|:----------------- |:----------- |:----------- |:----------- |
| **io**            | **-assi**   | **-essi**   | **-issi**   |
| **tu**            | **-assi**   | **-essi**   | **-issi**   |
| **lui, lei, Lei** | **-asse**   | **-esse**   | **-isse**   |
| **noi**           | **-assimo** | **-essimo** | **-issimo** |
| **voi**           | **-aste**   | **-este**   | **-iste**   |
| **loro**          | **-assero** | **-essero** | **-issero** |

|                         | **PARLARE**    | **VEDERE**    | **CAPIRE**    |
|:----------------------- |:-------------- |:------------- |:------------- |
| **(che) io**            | parl**assi**   | ved**essi**   | cap**issi**   |
| **(che) tu**            | parl**assi**   | ved**essi**   | cap**issi**   |
| **(che) lui, lei, Lei** | parl**asse**   | ved**esse**   | cap**isse**   |
| **(che) noi**           | parl**assimo** | ved**essimo** | cap**issimo** |

# Verbs: Past

Unlike the *imperfetto*, which refers to continuous or habitual actions in the past, the **passato remoto** is a tense that indicates a single action that was completed a long time ago. This tense presents *lots* of irregularities, and some verbs even have multiple correct conjugations. In fact, even native speakers find this tense a bit difficult sometimes, and that's probably why in the spoken language the *passato remoto* is often replaced by the *passato prossimo* (ho mangiato, ho bevuto...), which is easier and far more regular. Oddly enough, in southern Italy the exact opposite tends to happen: for some reason many southerners often prefer to use the *passato remoto*, even when talking about recent events.

So, why learn the **passato remoto**?

- Just because many native speakers try to avoid it, it doesn't mean they never use it! Some verbs in particular are very common and very easy to learn.
- It's without a doubt the most common tense in Italian literature, where events usually take place at some indefinite point in time, or in the distant past from the narrator's point of view.
- It will definitely take your Italian skills to the next level!

Here's an example with three different past tenses:

- Lui mi **diede** un consiglio. [passato remoto] = *He gave me advice. Once, a long time ago.*
- Lui mi **ha dato** un consiglio. [passato prossimo] = *He gave me advice. Once, maybe recently.*
- Lui mi **dava** consigli. [imperfetto] = *He gave me advice, for a period of time. / He used to give me advice.*

| common conjugations | **-ARE**      | **-ERE**              | **-IRE**      |
|:------------------- |:------------- |:--------------------- |:------------- |
| **io**              | parl**ai**    | ricev**ei/etti**      | part**ii**    |
| **tu**              | parl**asti**  | ricev**esti**         | part**isti**  |
| **lui, lei, Lei**   | parl**ò**     | ricev**é/ette**       | part**ì**     |
| **noi**             | parl**ammo**  | ricev**emmo**         | part**immo**  |
| **voi**             | parl**aste**  | ricev**este**         | part**iste**  |
| **loro**            | parl**arono** | ricev**erono/ettero** | part**irono** |

| some irregular conjugations | **ESSERE** | **AVERE** | **DIRE** |
|:--------------------------- |:---------- |:--------- |:-------- |
| **io**                      | fui        | ebbi      | dissi    |
| **tu**                      | fosti      | avesti    | dicesti  |
| **lui, lei, Lei**           | fu         | ebbe      | disse    |
| **noi**                     | fummo      | avemmo    | dicemmo  |
| **voi**                     | foste      | aveste    | diceste  |
| **loro**                    | furono     | ebbero    | dissero  |

You might be wondering, "how should I learn all those other irregular forms outside of Duolingo?" The same way native speakers do: through **exposure**, and mostly through **reading**! Luckily, many irregular verbs share the same patterns.
