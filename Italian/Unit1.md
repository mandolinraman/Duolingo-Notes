# Basics 1

Welcome to the Italian course! Remember that you can click on the words to see tips of possible translations.

*Personal pronouns*

The subject pronouns in Italian are:

- Io - *I*
- Tu - *Singular You (informal)*
- Lui - *He*
- Lei - *She* / *Singular You (formal)*
- Esso/Essa - *It* (archaic and literary)
- Noi - *We*
- Voi - *Plural You* / *You all*
- Loro - *They* (speaking of people)
- Essi/Esse - *They* (archaic and literary)

The verb is always conjugated to match the subject, and the subject is only specified for clarity or emphasis.

*Articles*

Articles have to match gender and number of the noun they refer to.

The singular determinate articles (*the*) are:

- Lo - masculine, used before Z, S+consonant, GN, and some rarer consonant clusters.
- Il - masculine, used before consonants except the above.
- La - feminine, used before all consonants.
- L' - an *elision* of the above used before vowels.

The indeterminate articles (*a*/*an*) are:

- Uno - masculine, used before Z, S+consonant, GN, and some rarer consonant clusters.
- Un - masculine, used in all other cases.
- Una - feminine, used before all consonants.
- Un' - feminine, used before vowels.

# Basics 2

*Plural articles*

The plural definite articles (*the*) are:

- *Gli* - for masculine nouns before vowels, Z, S+consonant, GN and some rarer consonant clusters.
- *I* - for masculine nouns in all other cases.
- *Le* - for feminine nouns.

*Articulated prepositions*

When some prepositions are followed by a definite article they merge into a single word.

- Article: il, lo, la, l', i, gli, le
- Di + article: del, dello, della, dell', dei, degli, delle
- A + article: al, allo, alla, all', ai, agli, alle
- Da + article: dal, dallo, dalla, dall', dai, dagli, dalle
- In + article: nel, nello, nella, nell', nei, negli, nelle
- Su + article: sul, sullo, sulla, sull', sui, sugli, sulle

The compounds formed by *con* and *per* are archaic and literary, with the exception of *col* (con + il) for which the contraction is optional.

# Common Phrases

*Negations*

In this section you'll use negations for the first time.

The English *no* has two main uses:

- Particle (e.g. "no!"): this translates directly to the Italian *no*.
- Determiner (e.g. "no one"): you'll learn the translations for this in a later section.

The English *not* almost always translates to the Italian *non*. However, while *not* often follows the verb it negates or its auxiliary, the Italian *non* always precedes it.

*Greetings*

- *Ciao* is used both ways in Italian: when meeting (also *salve*) and when parting (also *arrivederci* or *addio*).
- *Buongiorno* and *buonasera* are normally used when meeting, although they can be used when parting as well: the first is used in the first half of the day and the latter in the remaining half.
- *Buonanotte* is always used when parting, as it presumes that the day is over (same as "good night").
- *Prego* is a courtesy form used in many occasions to accompany a kind action, and it's the customary answer to reply to received thanks.
- *Per favore*, *per piacere* and *per cortesia* are courtesy forms used when asking for something.

# Food

*Ingredients*

Italian has three ways to express the presence of an ingredient in the name of a dish:

- *Dish* di *ingredient*: the ingredient is the main or only component of the dish, e.g. "succo di limone" (lemon juice). In this case the article is never used before the ingredient.
- *Dish* con *ingredient*: the ingredient is a visible component of the dish or used as garnish, e.g. "fragole con panna" (strawberries with cream). In this case a definite article can be used before the ingredient.
- *Dish* a *ingredient*: the dish has been flavored with the ingredient, or tastes like the ingredient, e.g. "gelato al cioccolato" (chocolate ice cream). In this case the definite article is mandatory before the ingredient, forming an articulated preposition with *a*.

When there is no room for confusion the three can occasionally be mixed up, e.g. "panino al salame" is as common as "panino con salame"; however, in many cases using one instead of the other can give hints on the dish's composition.

*Questions*

In this section you'll meet the first proper questions. In Italian word order doesn't change in a question, meaning that the question mark at the end and the raising tone of voice are usually the only differences between a question and a statement.

*Tips*

It's important to keep in mind that the English idiom of "having food" being synonymous with "eating food" doesn't apply to Italian, where "avere cibo" simply means owning food.

# Plurals

You already met some noun variations in gender and number in the past lessons.

The most common noun classes in Italian are the following:

- Nouns ending in *a* in the singular and *e* in the plural, e.g. "la ragazza" / "le ragazze": most nouns in this class are feminine.
- Nouns ending in *o* in the singular and *i* in the plural, e.g. "il ragazzo" / "i ragazzi": most nouns in this class are masculine.
- Nouns ending in *e* in the singular and *i* in the plural, e.g. "il pesce" / "i pesci": nouns in this class can be any gender.
- Nouns ending in *a* in the singular and *i* in the plural, e.g. "il problema" / "i problemi": most nouns in this class are masculine.

# Possessives

Italian possessives are in the form definite article (il, la, i, le) + possessive adjective. They agree with the gender and number of the thing they describe:

- My/Mine: "il mio", "la mia", "i miei", "le mie"
- Your/Yours (sing): "il tuo", "la tua", "i tuoi", "le tue"
- His/Hers/Its/Your (formal)/Yours (formal): "il suo", "la sua", "i suoi", "le sue"
- Our/Ours: "il nostro", "la nostra", "i nostri", "le nostre"
- Your/Yours (plur): "il vostro", "la vostra", "i vostri", "le vostre"
- Their/Theirs: "il loro", "la loro", "i loro", "le loro"

**il mio** cane *My dog* ("Cane" is masculine singular, so we use "il" and "mio.")

**la mia** pizza *My pizza* ("Pizza" is feminine singular, so we use "la" and "mia.")

Even though in English the possessive in the third person (his, her, its) varies based on the owner, remember that in Italian the gender and number are determined by the thing being owned:

il cane **di Giulia** > **il suo** cane ("Cane" is masculine, so we use the masculine, even though it is *her* dog.)

In Italian an article is almost always mandatory before a possessive. The exceptions are:

- It's not used before close family members, in the singular and not modified, e.g. "mio padre" (my father), unless the possessive is "loro" (in which case the article is needed).
- It's optional when the possessive adjective is alone following a form of "essere," e.g. "è mio" (it's mine).
- It's not used in a small number of set phrases, e.g. "casa mia" (my home).

Possessive pronouns (possessives acting as a noun) are formed using the definite article and the possessive. They agree with the object they describe, even if it is not explicitly mentioned in the sentence:

Dov'è la tua macchina? **La mia** è qui. *Where is your car? Mine is here.* (It is understood that "la mia" refers to my car, so it is feminine.)
