# Verbs: Present 1

In this section you'll learn some common verbs; let's have a look at the "tough" ones.

#### Conoscere vs Sapere

Both verbs translate the English "to know": that means that while the difference is obvious to speakers of other languages (e.g. German *kennen* vs *wissen*, Spanish *conocer* vs *saber*, Latin *cognoscere* vs *sapere*), it might be particularly hard for native English speakers.

- *Conoscere* means to be acquainted or familiar with someone or something: it's the way you "know" persons, places, or news.
- *Sapere* means to possess information about something: it's the way you know or learn most facts.

#### Piacere

This is the first verb you'll meet with a different transitiveness compared to English: it means "to like" but **the one being liked is the subject**! Again, this is something that speakers of other languages might be familiar with (e.g. German *gefällt mir*, Spanish *me gusta*, Latin *placet mihi*):

- (en) Juliet (subject) likes Romeo (direct object)
- (it) A Giulietta (indirect object) piace Romeo (subject) *or*
- (it) Romeo (subject) piace a Giulietta (indirect object).

Note that contrary to Spanish the indirect object doesn't need a reinforcement (A Julieta *le* gusta Romeo), and instead using one is often regarded as a grammar mistake.

# Colors

Most adjectives (like colors) in Italian have a masculine singular ending in either -O or -E. The ones that end in -O have separate feminine and masculine forms. Take for example "rosso":

il libro **rosso** / la camicia **rossa** / i libri **rossi** / le camicie **rosse**

Adjectives ending in E only have two forms: singular (-E) and plural (-I). They don't distinguish between masculine and feminine. "Verde" works this way:

il libro **verde** / la camicia **verde** / i libri **verdi** / le camicie **verdi**

With colors, certain words don't change at all (in the dictionary you'll see them called "invariable") because they are nouns, not adjectives. "Rosa" is an example of this, because it is the word for "rose":

il libro **rosa** / la camicia **rosa** / i libri **rosa** / le camicie **rosa**

# Conjunctions

Before a vowel (A, E, I, O, U), the conjunctions "e" and "o" and the preposition "a" may add a D (ed, od, ad). In current Italian grammar, this is optional, but is advised if the word following begins with the same letter (ed Elena, od olio, ad Alessandria). "Od" is used almost exclusively with words beginning with O, but you will see the others before other vowels ("ed io," for example).

# Prepositions

**Prepositions**, just like in English, don't always make sense. For example, things that in English are *in* something, in Italian may be *at* something. It very much depends on context, and/or on the verb that precedes them (again, just like in English). However, you'll find that most of the time English and Italian are not that different after all!

The main prepositions are *di, a, da, in, con, su, per, tra, fra*.

**Tra** and **fra** both mean *between*, or *among*, and they're almost completely interchangeable nowadays. However, it's better not to use *tra* before a *tr* sound, or *fra* before a *fr* sound.

- **Tra fr**atelli. = *Between/Among brothers.*
- **Fra tr**e persone. = *Between/Among three people.*

They can also mean **in**, when talking about time:

- Incontriamoci **tra/fra** due ore. = *Let's meet **in** two hours.*

The main difference between English and Italian, however, is that some Italian prepositions have to be combined with the article **the** whenever it ends up next to them. As you can see, *di* and *in* change into *de-* and *ne-* respectively, but the rest are quite predictable!

| Italian | English         | il              | lo        | la        | l'        | i              | gli       | le        |

# Adjectives 1

Like you saw with colors, most adjectives in Italian have masculine singular endings with either -O or -E. Adjectives ending in -O (like "alto") have four different forms:

**-O** (masculine singular) / **-A** (feminine singular) / **-I** (masculine plural) / **-E** (feminine plural)

Adjectives ending with -E (like "nazionale") only have two forms:

**-E** (masculine AND feminine singular) / **-I** (masculine AND feminine plural)

Most adjectives are placed AFTER the word they describe, for example: l'uomo **alto**

Some adjectives, such as those that describe size (grande/piccolo), quality (bello/bravo/cattivo) or age (giovane/vecchio/nuovo) can come before the thing they describe: una **brava** ragazza.

# Verbs: Present 2

The verb "mancare," when referring to people, works like "piacere": the indirect object misses the subject.

**Io** (subject) non **le** (indirect object) manco.

*She does not miss me.*

# Clitic Pronouns

In this section, you will see several different types of object pronouns: 1) **direct objects**, 2) **indirect objects**, 3) **objects of preposition**, 4) **reflexive pronouns**, 5) the **passive “si,”** and 5) **ci** and **ne**.

1) **Direct objects**

A *direct object* receives the action of the verb and answers the question, “What?” For example:

- Vedo la ragazza. *I see the girl.*

We can ask, “What do I see?” and answer “The girl.” So “la ragazza” is our direct object.

Just like how in English we can replace “the girl” with the pronoun “her,” in Italian we can replace direct objects with pronouns. The direct object pronouns are the following:

|                                            |                |                          |            |
|:------------------------------------------ |:-------------- |:------------------------ |:---------- |
| 1st person singular (me)                   | **mi**         | 1st person plural (us)   | **ci**     |
| 2nd person singular (you)                  | **ti**         | 2nd person plural (you)  | **vi**     |
| 3rd person singular (him, her, formal you) | **lo, la, La** | 3rd person plural (them) | **li, le** |

Usually these pronouns come **before** your verb. So the sentence “Vedo **la ragazza**” becomes “**La** vedo” (*I see **her***).

Sometimes pronouns are put after the verb for emphasis, and then use a different set of pronouns, called **tonic pronouns**:

|                                            |                   |                          |          |
|:------------------------------------------ |:----------------- |:------------------------ |:-------- |
| 1st person singular (me)                   | **me**            | 1st person plural (us)   | **noi**  |
| 2nd person singular (you)                  | **te**            | 2nd person plural (you)  | **voi**  |
| 3rd person singular (him, her, formal you) | **lui, lei, Lei** | 3rd person plural (them) | **loro** |

Except for “me” and “te,” these are the same forms as the subject pronouns. Going back to “Vedo la ragazza,” we can say “Vedo **lei**,” if we want to emphasize that it is *her* (not someone else).

2) **Indirect objects**

Like direct objects answer the question “What?” *indirect objects* usually answer the question “To whom?” or “For whom?” For example:

- Scrivo a mia sorella. *I write to my sister.*

“My sister” answers the question, “To whom do I write?” so “mia sorella” is the indirect object.

The indirect object pronouns look like the direct object pronouns, except the third person:

|                                               |                 |                             |         |
|:--------------------------------------------- |:--------------- |:--------------------------- |:------- |
| 1st person singular (to me)                   | **mi**          | 1st person plural (to us)   | **ci**  |
| 2nd person singular (to you)                  | **ti**          | 2nd person plural (to you)  | **vi**  |
| 3rd person singular (to him, her, formal you) | **gli, le, Le** | 3rd person plural (to them) | **gli** |

Like the direct object pronouns, these typically come before the verb:

- Scrivo a mia sorella. **Le** scrivo. *I write to my sister. I write to her.*

You can also use the tonic pronouns (see above) after the verb for emphasis or clarification, but with the indirect object, “a” is required:

- Scrivo **a lei**.

The only exception is “loro,” which does not require “a”:

- Scrivo ai miei amici. **Gli** scrivo. / Scrivo **loro**. *I write to my friends. I write to them.*
3) **Objects of preposition**

After a preposition (for example, “con,” “di,” “per”), you should use a **tonic pronoun** (see above):

- Non so niente di **te**. *I don’t know anything about you.*
4) **Reflexive pronouns**

In Italian, some verbs are reflexive, meaning that the person doing the action does it to him or herself. Examples of this would be “mettersi” (to put a piece of clothing on), “chiamarsi” (literally “to call oneself”), and “sentirsi” (to feel). In the dictionary, you may notice that the infinitive has “si” on the end to show the verb is reflexive.

Reflexive verbs have their own pronouns:

|               |        |      |        |
|:------------- |:------ |:---- |:------ |
| io            | **mi** | noi  | **ci** |
| tu            | **ti** | voi  | **vi** |
| lui, lei, Lei | **si** | loro | **si** |

These pronouns match the verb (“mi” with the “io” form, “ti” with “tu,” etc.) and are usually placed before the verb:

- **Mi** mett**o** la giacca. *I put on my coat.*
5) **The passive “si” (si passivante)**

We use the passive or impersonal “si” when we don't want to state who exactly did the action. This can be translated in different ways in English. For example:

- In Italia **si mangia** la pizza.

This could be translated as: *In Italy, pizza is eaten*, *In Italy, you (in general) eat pizza*, *In Italy, one eats pizza*, *In Italy, they (in general) eat pizza*, among other things. The important thing to remember is that this action is not being done by any specific person.

To form this, use “si” and a verb in the third person (the form for lui/lei or loro). If there is an object after the verb, the verb agrees with the object. So we say:

- Si mangi**a** la **pizza**.

but

- Si mangi**ano** le **pizze**.

If there is no object, the verb is singular:

- Si mangia.

For reflexive verbs, you add “ci” before “si”:

- **Ci** si alza presto. *One gets up early.*
6) **Ci** and **ne**

“Ci” and “ne” replace prepositional phrases. “Ci” replaces “in” or “a” and their object:

- Vai **a Roma**? No, non **ci** vado. *Are you going to Rome? No, I’m not going there.*

“Ne” replaces “di” and its object:

- Vuoi una **di queste caramelle**? **Ne** vuoi una? *Do you want one of these candies? Do you want one of them?*

# Numbers

#### Age

To express a person's age, Italian offers the choice of either a number or an adjective:

- When using a number, age is formulated as a number of years the person "has", e.g. "lei ha 14 anni" (she has 14 years -> she is 14 years old). This is the most commonly used form.
- When using an adjective, the latter is formed substituting "-enne" to the last letter of the number, e.g. "lei è quattordicenne" (she is 14 years old). This form cannot be used for ages 10 and lower, but allows substantivation, i.e. it's possible to say "la quattordicenne" to mean "the 14 y.o. girl".

#### Time

Alongside numbers, in this section you'll learn how to express the time of day: in Italian it is always expressed as a hour number, e.g.

- 1 AM -> l'una (one)
- 1 PM -> le tredici (thirteen)

The most common format is in multiples of 24 hours, but it's also possible to express it in multiples of 12, in which case to avoid confusion it could be necessary to specify the period of day:

- 1 AM -> l'una di notte (one in the night)
- 1 PM -> l'una del pomeriggio (one in the afternoon)

Minutes are expressed as additions (e) or subtractions (meno):

- 10 past 8 -> le otto e dieci (eight and ten)
- 10 to 8 -> le otto meno dieci (eight minus ten)
- a quarter to 8 -> le otto meno un quarto
- half past 8 -> le otto e mezza

# Verbs: Present Perfect

The Italian *passato prossimo* (near past tense) is very similar, in form and definition, to the English present perfect: however, there are some important differences to keep in mind.

- Just like in English, it is supposed to express a completed action close or with some relation to the present. The ongoing trend among Italian speakers, however, is to use the tense for all completed actions in the past, in place of the standard *passato remoto*.
- Contrary to present perfect in English, it is not limited to unspecified times, and can instead be used with a specific time indication. This means that in some cases, the English present perfect (has done, have seen, etc.) does not work as a translation for the Italian *passato prossimo*.

#### Auxiliary

In many cases the choice of auxiliary differs between English and Italian.

- Reflexive verbs always use essere: **Mi sono lavata** le mani. *I washed my hands.*
- Transitive verbs (verbs that take a direct object) normally use avere: **Ho visto** il cane. *I saw the dog.*
- Intransitive verbs (verbs that do not take a direct object) have no clear rule, and some verbs can use either.

#### Past participle

The past participle is a verbal adjective, and as such can be declined in gender and number.

- If the verb is conjugated with a third person direct object clitic (lo, la, l', li, le) or (with some exceptions) the partitive clitic (ne), it must match gender and number of the clitic:

Andrea **li** ha **letti**. *Andrea has read them.*

- If the verb is conjugated with any other direct object clitic, it can optionally match its gender and number:

Antonio **mi** ha **chiamata**. OR Antonio **mi** ha **chiamato**. *Antonio called me.* (For a feminine "me.")

- If the auxiliary is essere it must match gender and number of the subject.

Giulia non è **venuta**. *Giulia didn't come.*

- In any other case, the masculine singular form must be used.

# Verbs: Infinitive 1

The Italian infinitive has many uses.

- It's the common way to turn a verb into a noun, something for which English tends to prefer the gerund
- It's used for negative or generic imperatives
- It's also used in many, very common, *infinitive propositions*

As a rule, when the subject of a subordinate sentence is the same as the one of the main sentence, the subordinate should be "shortened" into an infinitive proposition: but in many cases the same happens for subordinates referring to the object of the main sentence, or acting as its object.

There is no clear-cut rule of which preposition to use before each infinitive, and sometimes synonyms require different ones, and the same verb might require a different preposition when used reflexively.

The verbs that can be followed directly by an infinitive are:

- Modal verbs (e.g. potere, dovere, volere, sapere)
- Perception verbs (e.g. vedere, sentire)
- Feeling verbs (e.g. piacere, amare, odiare, preferire)
- Causative verbs (e.g. fare, lasciare); not all, as e.g. permettere and ordinare need "di"

Most verbs need a preposition before the infinitive:

- *di* is by far the most common preposition to introduce an infinitive: the list includes among others the verbs of expression (e.g. dire, chiedere), thought (e.g. pensare, credere) and attempt (e.g. cercare, tentare - provare being an exception).
- *a* is mainly used for subordinates that are somewhat "after" the main sentence: as such the list includes verbs of movement (e.g. andare, venire), preparation (e.g. provare, prendere, mettersi), and hesitation (e.g. esitare, indugiare, tardare). If the main verb has an object, "a" can't be used to refer to the same subject.

The infinitive subordinate can also be introduced by other sentence elements for different effects, and in this case the prepositions are more loosely related to the main sentence:

- *di* can express specification, e.g. "aver bisogno di dormire" (having need to sleep, i.e. needing sleep).
- *da* usually expresses a passive meaning, e.g. "bollette da pagare" (bills to be paid).
- *a* can have a conditional meaning, e.g. "a sentire lui" (if hearing him, i.e. if you listen to his opinion), but with some adjectives it has the same passive meaning as "da", e.g. "facile a dirsi" (easy to say).
- *per* expresses purpose and finality, e.g. "per viaggiare" (in order to travel).
- *in* refers to the time in which the action is happening, e.g. "nel tornare a casa" (while coming back home).

# Verbs: Imperative

The **imperative** (commands) is used for giving instructions or orders. In this section, you will find commands for **tu**, **voi**, **Lei**, and **noi**. These are all formed in slightly different ways.

1) **Tu**

For *affirmative* commands for "tu," you use the 3rd person singular (the form for lui or lei) in the present for verbs with -ARE and the normal second person (tu) for -ERE and -IRE.

| Infinitive | Affirmative command |
|:---------- |:------------------- |
| CHIAMARE   | **Chiama!**         |
| LEGGERE    | **Leggi!**          |
| SENTIRE    | **Senti!**          |

With affirmative commands with "tu," pronouns are placed at the end of the verb:

- Chiama**mi**! *Call me!*

For *negative* commands for "tu," you use the infinitive:

| Infinitive | Negative command  |
|:---------- |:----------------- |
| CHIAMARE   | **Non chiamare!** |
| LEGGERE    | **Non leggere!**  |
| SENTIRE    | **Non sentire!**  |

With negative commands, pronouns can be placed *either* before or on the end of the verb:

- Non **mi** chiamare! / Non chiamar**mi**! *Don't call me!*

When attached to the end, the final E of the infinitive is dropped.

2) **Voi** and **Noi**

Forming commands with "voi" and "noi" is easy - you just use the normal present tense form!

- Chiamate! Non chiamate! *Call! Don't call!*
- Chiamiamo! Non chiamiamo! *Let's call! Let's not call!*

When adding pronouns to these commands, follow the same rules as with "tu" commands:

**Affirmative**: Chiamate**mi**! Chiamiamo**ci**! *Call me! Let's call each other!*

**Negative**: Non **mi** chiamate! / Non chiamate**mi**! Non **ci** chiamiamo! / Non chiamiamo**ci**!

3: **Lei**

Formal commands with "Lei" use the present subjunctive. You will learn the other forms of the subjunctive mood later. For now, the regular endings for Lei are:

| -ARE | -ERE | -IRE | -IRE (-isc-) |
|:---- |:---- |:---- |:------------ |
| -I   | -A   | -A   | -ISCA        |

| CHIAMARE | LEGGERE | SENTIRE | CAPIRE  |
|:-------- |:------- |:------- |:------- |
| CHIAMI   | LEGGA   | SENTA   | CAPISCA |

Words with an irregular "io" form will use that one as the stem for the formal imperative. For example:

Fare --> (io) faccio --> (Lei) faccia!

For the formal imperative, pronouns are always placed before the verb:

- **Mi** chiami! Non **mi** chiami! *Call me! Don't call me!*
