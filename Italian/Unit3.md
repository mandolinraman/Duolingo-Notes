# Verbs: Past Imperfect

The **imperfect** tense (l’imperfetto) is another past tense in Italian. Unlike the passato prossimo, which is used for defined actions in the past, the imperfect is used for actions without a set starting and ending point.

The imperfect has three primary uses:

- **Descriptions** or **background information**: This could include things like general physical or emotional states, appearance, age, weather conditions, etc. For example:

Paolo **era** alto. *Paolo was tall.*

Il bambino **aveva** due anni. *The child was two years old.*

- **Habitual actions**: These are actions that were repeated over and over in the past.

Quando ero piccola, **andavamo** sempre al mare. *When I was little, we always went to the beach.*

- **Actions in progress** or **interrupted actions**: In these cases, we catch the middle of the action.

**Parlavo** con mia madre quando ha suonato il telefono. *I was talking to my mother when the phone rang.*

------

Because English does not have an imperfect tense, we can use a variety of different structures to translate it. Consider the following paragraph:

> When I **was** a kid, I always **wanted** to be an artist. I **used to draw** pictures every day. I **would take** out my markers and I **would color** all afternoon.

In Italian, *all* of the phrases in bold would be in the imperfect. We must remember, then, that there is not a one-to-one correspondence to a certain structure in English. Likewise, when we see the simple past (“went,” for example), only context can tell us which Italian past tense is appropriate.

Because of this, it can sometimes be hard for English speakers to know when to use the imperfect and when to use the passato prossimo. Apart from being used in a similar way to the English present perfect (“have gone,” for example), the **passato prossimo** is used for completed actions in the past tied to a specific point in time or a specific length of time. We use the imperfect for the *midpoint* of an action, but the passato prossimo for the *beginning* or *end*.

Consider these sentences:

- Ieri **sono andata** dal dentista. *Yesterday I went to the dentist.*

In this case, I went to the dentist once, and this is a completed action.

In contrast, we can say:

- Quando abitavo a New York, **andavo** dal dentista ogni anno. *When I lived in New York, I went to the dentist every year.*

Here, going to the dentist is a repeated, habitual action. It does not have a clear ending or starting point.

We could also say:

- **Andavo** dal dentista quando **ho visto** il cane. *I was going to the dentist when I saw the dog.*

In this case, we have two actions. One, “andavo” (*I was going*), is an ongoing action (an action in progress), so we use the imperfect. The other, “ho visto” (*I saw*), is a complete action, confined to this set moment in time, so we use the passato prossimo.

# Verbs: Past Perfect

The **past perfect** (or pluperfect) in Italian is used very similarly to the past perfect in English (had been, had gone, had wanted, etc.).

Like in English, the past perfect is formed by a helping verb and a past participle. For example:

**Avevo mangiato** la pasta. *I had eaten the pasta.*

**Erano stati** a Roma. *They had been to Rome.*

As you can see, for the helping verb, you must choose between **essere** and **avere**. The rules for choosing the verb and agreement are the same as in the present perfect. The only difference is that the helping verb is in the imperfect.

# Medical

You may note when dealing with body parts that many have irregular plural forms. Some masculine words ending in -O in the singular (braccio, labbro, ginocchio, dito) become feminine in the plural and have the ending -A:

**il** bracci**o** - **le** bracci**a**

"Orecchio" is also an exception and uses the feminine for the plural, but with the normal feminine plural ending -E:

l'orecchi**o** - **le** orecchi**e**

# Verbs: Future

The **future tense**, or *futuro semplice*, is quite simple for the most part, but there are a few irregularities.

Some verbs lose the vowel before the last **r**.

- I will have = *io **avrò**,* and not *io averò.* [avere]
- I will see = *io **vedrò**,* and not *io vederò.* [vedere]

Among these verbs, those that would end in -nr- or -lr- end in -rr- instead.

- I will want = *io **vorrò**,* and not *io volrò.* [volere]
- I will come = *io **verrò**,* and not *io venrò.* [venire]

Finally, *stare, dare* and *fare* mantain their -ar- (*io starò, io darò, io farò* ), while *essere* changes its root altogether (*sa-* ).
