Hallo!

Did you know that German and English are in the same language family? German might seem tricky, but there are also a lot of similarities. Welcome to the German course! Let’s get started.

**So many capitals!**

In English, we capitalize some words, like people’s names. In German, you capitalize all nouns!

**K**affee und **T**ee

coffee and tea

**Wasser or Vasser?**

**Wasser**

**W**asser, **w**ir (as in “**v**ine”)

**Junge**

**J**unge, **j**a (as in “**y**es”)

**tschüss**

**tsch**üss (as in “**ch**ew”)

**Oh, hallo!**

**Hallo** and **tschüss** are typically used with friends. So, until next time:

Tschüss!

# Family

**Meine Familie!**

German families are generally small—typically, parents will have one or two children. Parents might be married or unmarried, and same‑sex couples are very common.

**Meine Mutter!**

German nouns have gender! Some nouns are masculine, like **Vater** and **Bruder**, while others are feminine, like **Mutter** and **Schwester**.

![img](https://d1btvuu4dwu627.cloudfront.net/7eea16a2572cb8a758f911276f810830/b1fbb0ee7d41b151654b20c88c6a944b/images/7cc8a24cbdc6439bb225e33fd1754d63.svg)

**eine** Mutter und **ein** Vater

a mother and a father

Notice that **ein** changes form! Words like **ein** or **mein** have different endings depending on the gender of the noun they’re paired with.

![img](https://d1btvuu4dwu627.cloudfront.net/7eea16a2572cb8a758f911276f810830/b1fbb0ee7d41b151654b20c88c6a944b/images/1f1d2348595f425b9673d472a28bd6c2.svg)

**mein** Bruder und **meine** Schwester

my brother and my sister

**I think, therefore...**

In English, we say **I am** but **you are**. In German, you do the same thing!

Ich **bin** Karl.

I am Karl.

Du **bist** sehr groß.

You are very tall.

Meine Schwester **ist** klug.

My sister is smart.

**Never vier!**

Here are some more sound differences between English and German!

**Vogel**

**V**ogel, **V**ater (as in “**f**ather”)

**ei**

m**ei**n, **ei**n (as in “**i**ce”)

**schwach**

schwa**ch**, To**ch**ter like clearing your throat

# Basics 2

**Pets**

In English, there’s a saying that a dog is a man’s best friend. But in Germany, cats are by far more popular than dogs!

**Seeing spots?**

Don’t worry, it’s not you! German vowels sometimes have two dots above them, called **umlauts**. They change the vowel’s pronunciation.

**ä**

B**ä**r (as in “r**a**re”)

**ö**

sch**ö**n say “**ee**”, but with “**o**” shaped lips

**A bit more gender**

Remember how you say **mein Vater** but **meine Mutter**? Well, **mein** isn’t the only word that changes form!

![img](https://d1btvuu4dwu627.cloudfront.net/7eea16a2572cb8a758f911276f810830/7a06b02f72814e2a0e23e98236c84a62/images/d34c2a8686034913a35afd0793fc42a5.svg)

**die** Frau, **der** Mann

the woman, the man

The word **der** also changes depending on the gender of the word it’s paired with. If it’s masculine, it’s **der**. If it’s feminine, it’s **die**.

**Hello, Ms. Cat!**

It’s not just words for people that have gender—all words do! For example, words like **Bär** and **Hund** are masculine, while **Eule** and **Katze** are feminine.

![img](https://d1btvuu4dwu627.cloudfront.net/7eea16a2572cb8a758f911276f810830/7a06b02f72814e2a0e23e98236c84a62/images/ef2250339f4747a9821abb63433a7df1.svg)

**der** Hund und **die** Katze

the dog and the cat

So how do you know if a word is feminine or masculine? Unfortunately, it’s not always logical— it’s just something you’ll have to learn!  So when you’re learning German words, don’t just memorize **Bär** or **Katze**. Instead, memorize the whole phrase, **der Bär** or **die Katze**.

# Greetings

**Guten Tag, Mr. Manager!**

When you are in a formal setting like an office, you’ll want to say **guten Tag** and **auf Wiedersehen**. It’s more polite than **hallo** and **bis bald**.

**Shh! Listen up!**

Lots of German words have a silent **h**. This silent **h** makes the vowel before it just a little bit longer.

**eh**

es g**eh**t, auf Wieders**eh**en (as in “d**ay**”)

**oh**

S**oh**n (as in “z**o**ne”)

# Restaurant

**Mineralwasser, anyone?**

Did you know that the most popular drink in Germany is sparkling water? It’s more popular than beer! Many restaurants don’t offer free tap water, so you’ll have to order a glass of sparkling water too.

**All of the genders!**

There’s no reason why **der Salat** is masculine and **die Pizza** is feminine. That’s just how it is! But wait, there’s a third gender: neuter! Neuter nouns go with **das** and **ein**.

![img](https://d1btvuu4dwu627.cloudfront.net/7eea16a2572cb8a758f911276f810830/29605c1e2783d6da2d4edbcb1234510e/images/f8a86bd688a042c7a67714547d6650b7.svg)

**das** Sandwich, **ein** Sandwich

the sandwich, a sandwich

**Did you, uh, know this?**

Did you notice that **‑er** at the end of a word is pronounced like **uh**? Give it a try!

**Wasser**

Wass**er** (as in “**uh**”)

**Schwester**

Schwest**er** (as in “**uh**”)

# Places

**Who else speaks German?**

Besides Duo, you, and people in Germany, who else speaks German? You can find many German speakers in Austria and Switzerland. There are also pockets of German speakers in Africa, South America, and the United States.

**Are you? You are!**

Have you ever played Twenty Questions?  Well, to ask yes or no questions in German, just switch the position of the subject and the verb.

![img](https://d1btvuu4dwu627.cloudfront.net/7eea16a2572cb8a758f911276f810830/a1dd4ac7b6ec844854bb96be70e90cfb/images/b318f0a258384b1ca6500b8006187e66.svg)

**Kanada ist** groß.

Canada is big.

**Ist Kanada** groß?

Is Canada big?

**How will this end?**

In German, verb endings change depending on if you’re talking about **ich**, **du**, and so on.

![img](https://d1btvuu4dwu627.cloudfront.net/7eea16a2572cb8a758f911276f810830/a1dd4ac7b6ec844854bb96be70e90cfb/images/137df933d58e4cb4a719dbb2f1bba9e4.svg)

**Ich** komm**e** aus Amerika.

I come from America.

**Du** komm**st** aus Deutschland.

You come from Germany.

For most verbs, you add an **‑e** for **ich**, and **‑st** for **du**. You’ll learn other endings as we go along!

**Pronunciation practice!**

Let’s practice some more vowels!

**ü**

M**ü**nchen, tsch**ü**ss say “**ee**”, but with “**oo**” shaped lips

**eu**

D**eu**tschland, t**eu**er    (as in “ah**oy**”)

# Jobs

**Professions**

Just as **waiter** and **waitress** correspond to different genders, all professions in German have a masculine and feminine version. The feminine ones end with **‑in**!

![img](https://d1btvuu4dwu627.cloudfront.net/7eea16a2572cb8a758f911276f810830/ddcfbbb0aaae1e8f90e4465704b68422/images/941bc097a8984752871956b22e2ef65f.svg)

der Kellner, die Kellner**in**

the waiter, the waitress

**You are German student!**

You are your profession! In English, we say **I am an actor**, but in German, you just say **I am actor**.

![img](https://d1btvuu4dwu627.cloudfront.net/7eea16a2572cb8a758f911276f810830/ddcfbbb0aaae1e8f90e4465704b68422/images/56be60a2ed444cebad3ba458e0020df0.svg)

Ich bin **Schauspieler**.

I am an actor.

![img](https://d1btvuu4dwu627.cloudfront.net/7eea16a2572cb8a758f911276f810830/ddcfbbb0aaae1e8f90e4465704b68422/images/52e438e58f0d494e9b298bc728097998.svg)

Meine Mutter ist **Professorin**.

My mother is a professor.

**What’s mein is dein!**

Remember how **mein** goes with masculine nouns and **meine** with feminine ones? It’s the same with **dein** and **deine**.

![img](https://d1btvuu4dwu627.cloudfront.net/7eea16a2572cb8a758f911276f810830/ddcfbbb0aaae1e8f90e4465704b68422/images/b3b527bff70b4e08950f3b6220e4c3a3.svg)

**Dein** Vater ist Lehrer.

Your father is a teacher.

![img](https://d1btvuu4dwu627.cloudfront.net/7eea16a2572cb8a758f911276f810830/ddcfbbb0aaae1e8f90e4465704b68422/images/d9491d28a18943659368d30659e5cab0.svg)

**Deine** Mutter ist Ärztin.

Your mother is a doctor.

**Shh! It’s time to listen!**

You will hear the **sh** sound whenever you see **sch**, or when a word begins with **st‑** or **sp‑**. Can you hear it?

**schön**

**sch**ön, **Sch**üler (as in “**sh**oe”)

**später**

**sp**äter, **sp**ielen starts with “**sh**”

 **Stern**

**St**ern, **St**udent starts with “**sh**”

# Hobbies

**Green thumbs**

In Germany, people really like to garden. Ever heard of a **Schrebergarten**? It’s a small plot of land outside the city that people can purchase and tend as their garden.

**Different strokes for different folks**

Verbs have different endings depending on the subject of the sentence. Lucky for you, **er**  and **sie** use the same ending!

| **subject** | **verb (schwimmen)** |
| ----------- | -------------------- |
| ich         | schwimm**e**         |
| du          | schwimm**st**        |
| er / sie    | schwimm**t**         |

**Second is the best**

In German statements, the verb is in the second place, or the second chunk. As you continue learning, other parts might move around while the important second place stays put!

Ich **male** sehr gern.

I really like to paint.

Mein Bruder **spielt** immer Schach.

My brother always plays chess.

# Directions

**Those shoes were made for walking!**

Many people in Germany use public transportation to get around. In cities, there are also places called **Fußgängerzonen**, where you have to go by foot because vehicles aren’t allowed.

**The, the, and the**

Remember that all nouns have a gender, and that **der** and **ein** change form depending on that gender.

| **gender** | **noun**                            |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
| masculine  | **der** Bahnhof, **ein** Bahnhof    |
| feminine   | **die** Bäckerei, **eine** Bäckerei |
| neuter     | **das** Kino, **ein** Kino          |

**Hissy fit**

The **ch** sound in **ich** and **rechts** isn’t as far back in the throat as **Tochter** or **Buch**.

**ich**

i**ch**, re**ch**ts like “**h**umid”, but stronger

**schwach**

schwa**ch**, To**ch**ter like clearing your throat

Many adjectives end with **‑ig**, which is pronounced just like **ich**!

**‑ig**

bill**ig**, stress**ig** (as in “i**ch**”)
