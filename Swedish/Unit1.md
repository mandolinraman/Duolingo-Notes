# Basics

#### Two genders – but four pronouns!

That seems a bit overkill - but it is actually quite logical (we Swedes like logic).

First of all you might wonder what a gender is. Well, there are two kinds of gender – natural (male and female) and grammatical gender.

English only uses natural gender ("he" for males, "she" for females and "it" for objects) whereas Romance languages such as French use natural genders ("he" and "she") as grammatical gender as well (everything is thus either a "he" or a "she" in French).

Swedish has a double system. When talking about people, we use the natural gender (he and she) but when we aren't talking about humans, you have to look at the grammatical gender. Swedish words belong either to the **en-words** (also called *n-words*, *common gender* or *utrum*) or to the **ett-words** (also called *t-words*, *neuter* or *neutrum*).

The names **en-words** and **ett-words** are derived from the indefinite article (singular) of each group, both corresponding to **a(n)** in English.

Examples

| Female        | Male         | En-words     | Ett-words    |
|:------------- |:------------ |:------------ |:------------ |
| **hon** *she* | **han** *he* | **den** *it* | **det** *it* |

# Basics 2

#### Introducing new stuff with det är

In Swedish, when we start talking about something new, or point out what something is, we use the construction *det är*. It is a lot like *it is* in English, but there's an important difference: the Swedish construction never changes. We use it for *ett* words and *en* words, for people and for plural objects, and it's always *det är*. So we say:

*Det är ett äpple* – It is an apple
*Det är en bok* – It is a book
*Det är en flicka* – It is a girl
*Det är tidningar* – They are newspapers

#### This and that in Swedish

You're going to learn about this more in depth later, but in case you wonder if you couldn't just say *this* or *that* when we say *det är*, here's the deal:

- There are two ways to say *this* in Swedish: either *det här/den här* or *detta/denna*.

- The Swedish counterpart to *that* is *det där/den där*, but sometimes you can also use *det/den* to mean *that*.

Those words are taught a little later in the course so you don't need to worry about them just yet, but just in case you were wondering.

# Common Phrases

#### Välkommen!

This means "welcome", but we don't use it in the expression *you're welcome*. That would be **varsågod**.

#### ”I speak -ska”

Nope, Swedes don’t have a particular thing for ska music but most names of languages are derived from the name of the country, the adjective or the nationality with the ending –ska added to it.

Examples

| Country               | Adjective                | Nationality                      | Language                          |
|:--------------------- |:------------------------ |:-------------------------------- |:--------------------------------- |
| **Sverige** *Sweden*  | **svensk(t)** *swedish*  | **en svensk** *a Swede*          | **svenska** *Swedish (language)*  |
| **England** *England* | **engelsk(t)** *English* | **en engelsman** *an Englishman* | **engelska** *English (language)* |

Oh, and as you have probably already noticed, we do not capitalize adjectives, nationalities or languages (only countries). Unless they happen to come first in the sentence, of course.

# Food

### ”A glass and glass-the”

Swedish uses two separate indefinite articles, both equivalent to the English *a(n)*, **en** and **ett**. The former is used with **en-words** and the latter with **ett-words**, hence the names of the two groups.

#### When it comes to the definite form, it gets weird.

Swedish does not use a separate article like English *the*, instead, we add an ending to the word in question. Guess which one!

**en-words** take *-en* and **ett-words** take *-et*.

However, we do not like to have two vowels next to each other (we just think it sounds wrong). So should the word end in a vowel, we just add the corresponding consonant.

###### Sometimes we drop the last -e- or -a- in the word (e.g. “en gaffel” – “gaffeln”) but you don't need to worry about that quite yet!

Examples

| Indefinite singular    | Definite singular      |
|:---------------------- |:---------------------- |
| **en sked** *a spoon*  | **skeden** *the spoon* |
| **ett glas** *a glass* | **glaset** *the glass* |

# Animals

#### Fågeln och spindeln

Hmm... did you spot the definite article at the end? Looks a bit strange, doesn't it? One would have expected *"fågelen"* and *"spindelen"*. Well, to be honest, you can - in some Swedish regions (in the South for instance).

The *en*-word endings **–el**, **–en**, **–er** and **–ar** are very hungry endings so they eat up the following **-e-**, leaving us with only a consonant.

Examples

| Indefinite                | Definite                  |
|:------------------------- |:------------------------- |
| **en fågel** *a bird*     | **fågeln** *the bird*     |
| **en spindel** *a spider* | **spindeln** *the spider* |

#### A Møøse once bit my sister...

The national animal of Sweden is The King of the Forest, Alces alces, in American English known as the *moose*. In British English, this animal is called as an *elk*. Just to make things more complicated, there's an American animal called *elk* which is not at all the same animal as the *moose* or what the Brits call an *elk*, this is *Cervus canadensis*, also known as a *wapiti* (in Swedish: *en wapitihjort*, but we don't have them here).
Complications don't stop there. The normal plural of both *moose* and *elk* is the same as the singular, so that it's *one moose, several moose* and *one elk, several elk*. The Swedish word behaves perfectly normal though: *en älg, älgen* in the singular, and in the plural: *älgar, älgarna*.
There are lots of moose in Sweden. The yearly hunt is a big deal, notably the king likes to shoot the big animal. Moose can be a big traffic problem. There are road signs with moose on them to warn for them, these have become a sort of tourist symbol for Sweden, and especially German tourists have been known to steal those signs as souvenirs. Young moose are not shy and often like to enter people's gardens to eat apples.
There's also usually at least one kid in every school who looks a lot like a moose and is nicknamed The moose. :P

# Definite Forms

#### Indefinite and definite singular

All Swedish words are divided into two groups: *en-words* (or *utrum*) and *ett-words* (or *neutrum*). Unfortunately, you cannot know to which group a certain word belongs but there are some tips to have a greater chance of guessing right.

- Most words are *en-words*
- Most words designating a person are *en-words* ¹
- Have a look at the ending, many endings take the same article (e.g. **–a**² , **–ing** and **–het** are always *en-words*)

¹ One common exception is **ett barn** *a child*
² The only exceptions are **ett öga**, **ett öra** and **ett hjärta**.

#### Forms

The indefinite singular always takes an article. *en-words* take **en** and *ett-words* take **ett**

To form the definite form you simply add **-en** to the *en-words* and **-et** to the *ett-words*.

Examples

| Indefinite          | Definite             |
|:------------------- |:-------------------- |
| **en bok** *a book* | **boken** *the book* |

**Liebe Deutschsprachige & Lieve Nederlandstalige** A special warning to you: in the vast majority of the cases, the ending **-en is not a plural ending**, as is German and Dutch! "Studenten" means **the** student. The plural of "student" is in fact "student**er**).

#### Special cases

Swedish does not like to have two vowels next to each other, so if a word ends in a vowel, we drop the *-e-* in the ending.

Examples

| Indefinite               | Definite                |
|:------------------------ |:----------------------- |
| **en soppa** *a soup*    | **soppan** *the soup*   |
| **ett kaffe** *a coffee* | **kaffet** *the coffee* |

Sometimes, we do keep the *-e-* in the ending, but we drop the *-e-* in the preceding syllable instead. This happens to *ett*-words ending in **–el**, **–en**, and **–er**.

Examples

| Indefinite               | Definite                |
|:------------------------ |:----------------------- |
| **ett vatten** *a water* | **vattnet** *the water* |
| **socker** *a sugar*     | **sockret** *the sugar* |

**But why, oh, why do you do this to me?**
Because “vattenet”, “sockeret” would be too blurry and sound way too Danish!

# Plurals

#### Plurals

Swedish plurals have a reputation for being irregular and hard to learn. This is, in fact, *not true*. While there are certainly many irregular plural forms in Swedish, there is also a lot of predictability, and a large amount of words are entirely predictable if you know the rules!

Below are the 5 normal Swedish plural forms - both indefinite and definite.

| Singular  | Plural indefinite | Plural definite |
|:--------- |:----------------- |:--------------- |
| en kvinna | kvinn**or**       | kvinn**orna**   |
| en hund   | hund**ar**        | hund**arna**    |
| en sak    | sak**er**         | sak**erna**     |
| ett hus   | hus               | hus**en**       |
| ett yrke  | yrke**n**         | yrke**na**      |

#### How to predict the plural

##### En-words

- **-a** → **-or**
  en kvinn**a** → kvinn**or**
  en gat**a** → gat**or**
- **-e** → **-ar**
  en pojk**e** → pojk**ar**
- Words in **-are** have no special plural form.
  en läk**are** → läk**are**
- **-ing** → -ing**ar**
  en tidn**ing** → tidning**ar**
- Words with stress on the final syllable always take **-er**.
  en ele*fant* → elefant**er**
  en sta*tion* → station**er**
  en i*dé* → idé**er**
- Words ending in **-el**, -**-er** and **-en** usually take **-ar**, losing their *e* in the process.
  en fåg**el** → fåg**lar**
  en vint**er** → vint**rar**
- One-syllable words can take either **-ar** or **-er**, usually the former.
  en hund → hund**ar**
  en färg → färg**er**

##### Ett-words

- If they end in a consonant, they have no plural ending.
  ett hus → hus
  ett barn → barn
- If they end in a vowel, they take **-n**.
  ett yrke → yrke**n**
  ett meddelande → meddelande**n**

#### Irregular plurals

There are several irregular plural forms, usually these include changing the main vowel.

en man → m**ä**n
en mus → m**ö**ss
en hand → h**ä**nd**er**
en bok → b**ö**ck**er**

#### The ending -en

It's important to remember that the ending **-en** can be one of three things:

1. the definite singular of an *en*-word

2. the definite plural of an *ett*-word ending in a consonant

3. the indefinite plural of an *ett*-word ending in a vowel
   Beware of this common trap for students of Swedish!

arm**en** *the arm*
hus**en** *the houses*
äppl**en** *apples*
