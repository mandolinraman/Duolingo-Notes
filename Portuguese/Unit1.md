# Basics 1

### Welcome to the Portuguese course :D

In these basic lessons, you are going to see some words for people, such as man, woman, boy and girl, and also some basic verbs for eating, drinking, etc.

The two first things you will notice is that:

**1 - Personal pronouns may be omitted**, especially when the verb conjugation is unique for that pronoun.

- **I** am a man = **(Eu)** sou um homem

In the sentence above, "eu" is totally optional. The verb "sou" is unique for the "eu" pronoun, and it already reveals who the subject is. (Later you will learn how to conjugate verbs for each person)

**2 - Portuguese nouns have genders**, even when they are not human!

Not only people and animals are gendered in Portuguese, but virtually all things are.

For instance, "maçã (apple)" is a feminine word, and "carro (car)" is masculine.

**THE INDEFINITE ARTICLES "UM" AND "UMA"**

Along with nouns, articles also have genders. They follow the gender of the noun they refer to. The masculine article is "um" and the feminine one is "uma":

**Masculine:**

- Um menino = a boy

- Um carro = a car

**Feminine:**

- Uma menina = a girl

- Uma maçã = an apple

**But how can one tell the gender of a word?**

Some words tell their gender by their ending. See "menin**o**" and "menin**a**", for instance. They are a type of word that can change its ending based on gender. These will often end in "o" for masculine and "a" for feminine.

There are other typical endings that can show a word's gender, but they are part of further skills :)

And, unfortunately, many words simply don't follow any pattern, and their gender just have to be memorised.

# Basics 2

**DEFINITE ARTICLES - "O" AND "A"**

Just like the indefinite articles, definite ones also follow the gender of the nouns:

- **O** livro = **The** book (masculine)

- **A** chave = **The** key (feminine)

Be careful not to confuse the English "a" for the Portuguese "a":

- **A** bola = **The** ball

- **Uma** bola = **A** ball

**VERB CONJUGATIONS**

Verbs in Portuguese change depending on who is doing the action. This happens in English when, for instance, "to write" gets conjugated as "he write**s**."

In Portuguese, however, verbs have a different conjugation for each grammatical person.

Here we will focus on the first and third person singular conjugations: "eu" and "ele/ela".

| Eng. Person    | Port. Person | Ser   | Ler  | **Comer** (3) |
|:-------------- |:------------ |:----- |:---- |:------------- |
| I              | Eu           | Sou   | Leio | **Como**      |
| He / She / It  | Ele / Ela    | É     | Lê   | **Come**      |
| You (singular) | Você (1)     | É (2) | Lê   | **Come**      |

(1) - "Você" is the singular "you". This pronoun, although referring to the second person, follows third person conjugations. Later we will see the pronoun "tu", which actually follows second person conjugations.

(2) - Don't confuse "é" for "e". The accend makes a difference here - "É" is a verb, "e" means "and".

(3) - In this table, "comer" (to eat) is a regular verb. All regular verbs ending in "er" follow the same pattern for their endings. "Ler" is an example of an irregular verb. It tries to follow the same endings, but with some changes.

**WHERE IS "IT"?"**

Sometimes, the word "it" is just not translated, depending on how concrete it is. In sentences like "it is ...", the best translations usually have nothing translating "it":

- **He** is a boy = **Ele** é um menino

- **It** is a boy = _ É um menino

But when "it" is an animal or something relevant, something that actually exists, we still use "ele" or "ela" depending on the noun's gender:

- I have a car, **it** is red = Eu tenho um carro, **ele** é vermelho ("carro" is masculine)

- He has a house, **it** is big = Ele tem uma casa, **ela** é grande ("casa" is feminine)

**Can we omit other pronouns?**

Yes, we can omit any pronoun in Portuguese. But keep in mind that if the conjugation is not clear, it's better not to omit anything.

For instance, "come" can refer to "ele", "ela", "você" or even be an imperative verb. For that reason, we avoid omitting the pronoun in these cases.

# Common Phrases

### Common Phrases!!

One of the most important things about different languages is that they also have different expressions.

You will notice sometimes that "word by word" translations can result in sentences that simply don't make any sense.

Remember: **different languages think different!**

In this skill, you will find some of those differences.

### Questions

Just a grammar tip before you start:

Portuguese does not invert word order or add auxiliary verbs for asking questions, just add the question mark and you are ready to go!

- Você fala português! = You speak Portuguese!
- Você fala português? = Do you speak Portuguese?

### Thanking people:

- Thank you = obrigado (if you are a man)
- Thank you = obrigada (if you are a woman)

We don't really translate the "you" in that expression, we see it as a whole thing.

- You are welcome! = De nada! - This is what you answer when someone thanks you.

### Welcoming people:

To welcome people, we use "bem-vindo". As an adjective, it inflects according to gender and number.

Translations of "Welcome!":

| Gender    | Number   | Imperative "to be" (optional) (1) | Welcome    |
|:--------- |:-------- |:--------------------------------- |:---------- |
| Masculine | Singular | Seja                              | Bem-vindo  |
| Feminine  | Singular | Seja                              | Bem-vinda  |
| Masculine | Plural   | Sejam                             | Bem-vindos |
| Feminine  | Plural   | Sejam                             | Bem-vindas |

(1) Don't worry too much about the imperative conjugations now, there will be lessons for it later :)

- You are welcome! = Você é bem-vindo(a) - this is the literal translation when you say someone is welcome somewhere. It's not an answer to "thank you".

**Plural or singular?**

In many cases, English does not allow **countable** nouns to be in **singular** form without articles.

That is not the case in Portuguese. **Singular countable nouns** with no articles in Portuguese will have a **general meaning**, similar to an English plural or an English singular with an indefinite article, depending on the context.

So, both Portuguese sentences below are just ok:

- Ele é cozinheiro = He is a cook

- Ele não come ovo = He does not eat eggs

Their versions with articles or in plural forms are valid as well:

- Ele é cozinheiro = Ele é um cozinheiro

- Ele não come ovo = Ele não come ovos

.
**Verb for eating**

Aside from idiomatic expressions, the only verb for eating in Portuguese is "comer".

The verb "ter" is translated as "to have", but only in the sense of "possess/own/contain":

- Nós comemos peixe = We eat fish

- Nós temos peixe = We have **got** fish

.
**Verbs for drinking**

For drinking, there is the verb "beber".
It's possible in less formal contexts to also use "tomar". But tomar only means "to drink" if used with actual drinks. Sentences without the objects will sound strange with "tomar".

# Plurals

### Nouns - Basic rules

Portuguese plurals are similar to English plurals. Add an "s" to the word and follow a few patterns. :)

But there is an important difference: all adjectives, articles, possessives and determiners pointing to the noun must be also changed to plural, according to the noun.

**Some patterns:**

- Ending in vowels: add an "s"

  - O menino > Os meninos
  - A menina > As meninas

- Ending in "r", "s", "z": add "es"

  - A mulher > As mulheres

- Ending in "M": change to "ns"

  - O homem > Os homens

- Ending in "L": change to "is" (don't repeat the "i")

  - O animal > Os animais

  - O papel > Os papéis (the papers)

  - O funil > Os funis (the funnels)

  - ("e" and "o" will need an accent if the word doesn't have one already)

- There are other patterns, but they're not necessary at this point :)

Two advanced examples, one masculine and one feminine, just to illustrate the rules:

- O**s** teu**s** livro**s** são vermelho**s** = Your books are red

- A**s** tua**s** maçã**s** são vermelha**s** = Your apples are red

### Personal pronouns

The plural of the pronouns seen so far are:

| Singular            | Plural           |
|:------------------- |:---------------- |
| I = Eu              | We = Nós         |
| He/She/It = Ele/Ela | They = Eles/Elas |
| You = Você          | You = Vocês      |

Notice that it's important to distinguish between singular and plural "you" in Portuguese!

### Verbs - Conjugations

Different from English, Portuguese not only has different conjugations for "ele/ela", but for each person, singular and plural.

There are three types of regular verbs. They end in either "ar", "er" or "ir", and each type follow a pattern.

|           | Fritar   | Comer   | Abrir   |
|:--------- |:-------- |:------- |:------- |
| Eu        | Frito    | Como    | Abro    |
| Ele/Ela   | Frita    | Come    | Abre    |
| Nós       | Fritamos | Comemos | Abrimos |
| Eles/Elas | Fritam   | Comem   | Abrem   |

`*` - Conjugations for "você" are the same as "ele/ela"
`*` - Conjugations for "vocês" are the same as "eles/elas"

Some irregular verbs for this skill:

|           | Ser   | Ler   |
|:--------- |:----- |:----- |
| Eu        | Sou   | Leio  |
| Ele/Ela   | É     | Lê    |
| Nós       | Somos | Lemos |
| Eles/Elas | São   | Leem  |

# Tu or Você

#### Tu and você, what is the difference?

In Portuguese, there are two very common ways to refer to "you (singular)": **tu** and **você**

Both words mean you, but only "tu" is truly a second person pronoun according to grammar. (Você is a treatment pronoun that uses third person conjugations)

**Is one more formal than the other?**

That will depend a lot on what region we are talking about. Some people see "tu" as an informal thing, others don't.

With time, several regions of Brazil chose "você" as the standard way of saying you. Other regions, however, kept "tu" as the most common form.

Examples of places that use "tu" very often are Portugal, Portuguese speaking countries in Asia and Africa and the south of Brazil.

### Conjugations

The verb conjugations for each one are different. While "tu" uses true second person conjugations (the ones you see in tables), "você" uses third person conjugations (the ones for "ele/ela"):

| Conjugations | andar | correr | abrir |
|:------------ |:----- |:------ |:----- |
| Tu           | andas | corres | abres |
| Você         | anda  | corre  | abre  |

In speech, it is very common to see people using "tu" with "você conjugations", but that is not grammatically correct.

### Plural second person (obsolete)

Alternatively to "vocês", there is "vós", which is the plural you. But this form is quite obsolete and very rare. You can find it in old books.

If you're curious, its conjugations are:

- Vós andais, correis, abris (regular conjugations)

- Vós sois = you are

- Vós ledes = you read

# Informal "we" - A gente

Although meaning "people" in many cases, the word "gente", when used with the article "a", means "we/us".

- A gente = we / us

This is a very common way of speaking, so common that it makes the expression "a gente" be avoided when one means "the people".

For "the people", normally "as pessoas" or "o povo" are used.

All conjugations for "a gente" are singular, matching the "ele/ela" conjugations:

- A gente tem uma casa = We have a house

- O gato vê a gente = The cat sees us

# Adjectives 1

### Adjective inflections

As you may have noticed up to now, adjectives in Portuguese **must be inflected** according to the noun they refer to, **even when connected with a linking verb such as "to be"**.

Adjectives change in gender and number:

- Carro nov**o** = New car (singular masculine)
- Carros nov**os** = New cars (plural masculine)
- A casa é nov**a** = The house is new (singular feminine)
- As casas são nov**as** = The houses are new (plural feminine)

Some of them, especially those ending in "e" or a consonant in singular form, have their masculine and feminine forms the same:

- Carro grand**e**, casa grand**e**
- Carros grand**es**, casas grand**es**
- Homem responsáve**l**, mulher responsáve**l**
- Homens responsáve**is**, mulheres responsáve**is**

That doesn't mean they ignore the rule that "all should be inflected" though, they just don't have different forms.

### Adjective positioning

Should they come before or after the noun?

This question is not so easy to answer. Mostly, adjectives should come after the nouns, but some can only come before nouns, some can only go after nouns, and some can go anywhere, with a slight change in meaning.

**Adjectives that can go anywhere**

The adjectives that can be placed either before or after the noun can have a slight change in meaning depending on the position.

Adjectives after nouns get a very literal meaning, while adjectives before nouns can get a more sentimental meaning:

- Um homem grande = A big man (size)
- Um grande homem = A great man
- Uma casa velha = An old house (an aged house, probably showing some problems)
- Uma velha casa = An old house (probably full of stories and feelings, or well known)

This is not a strict rule though, intonation might have an influence too and many adjectives wouldn't be able to show any difference in meaning.

**Adjectives that can't change position**

There is nothing special about them, but they just don't fit both positions, such as:

- Cultural - only after
- Impossível - only after
- Familiar - only after - Family (adjective)
- Nacional - only after
- Industrial - only after
- Primeiro - only before (except in titles such as "Pedro Primeiro - Pedro the first")

# Possessives

### Possessives

Portuguese regular possessive adjectives and pronouns are somewhat similar to English, but there are some differences. In Portuguese, they follow a few rules.

**English-like rules:**

- Their **stem/base form** gives information about the **possessor** (the person/thing who owns it).

- **Adjective possessives** usually show up **before the noun** (while placing them afterwards is not strictly wrong, it’s very rare – usually a style choice in books and poems).

**Differences:**

- The base form needs to be **declined** according to the **gender** and **number** of **the noun it’s qualifying**. (Just like adjectives and articles)

- Possessive **adjectives and pronouns** in Portuguese **are exactly the same**. There is no extra "s" like in "your x yours"; **the –s endings** you may encounter **are plural markers**.

- The regular possessive adjectives **can be preceded by** the corresponding **definite article** ("o meu", "a minha"...), but in Brazilian Portuguese using the article is mostly **optional**.

These are the regular pronouns and their inflections:

| Owner                    | Masc. sing. | Fem. sing. | Masc. plural | Fem. plural |
|:------------------------ |:----------- |:---------- |:------------ |:----------- |
| **Eu**                   | (o) meu     | (a) minha  | (os) meus    | (as) minhas |
| **Tu**                   | (o) teu     | (a) tua    | (os) teus    | (as) tuas   |
| **Você**, **Ele/Ela**    | (o) seu     | (a) sua    | (os) seus    | (as) suas   |
| **Nós**                  | (o) nosso   | (a) nossa  | (os) nossos  | (as) nossas |
| **Vós**                  | (o) vosso   | (a) vossa  | (os) vossos  | (as) vossas |
| **Vocês**, **Eles/Elas** | (o) seu     | (a) sua    | (os) seus    | (as) suas   |

.
**Examples:**

- O meu carro é vermelho = My car is red

- Minha casa é azul = My house is blue

- Meus gatos são brancos = My cats are white

- As minhas meias são pretas = My socks are black

#### Articles with possessive pronouns

While the possessive **adjectives** (coming before nouns) can have **optional** articles, the possessive **pronouns** (that don't precede nouns) must use the articles consistently.

One way of checking whether the article should be used is inverting the English sentence to the unusual "of him" form.
Then the article should behave in a similar way in both languages. (Please consider that this unusual English form is not commonly accepted as English translations in the system)

- O cachorro dele quer água = His dog wants water (checking: **the** dog of him wants water - necessary article)

Sometimes, the article is optional, but meaning is changed:

- Esses carros são meus = These cars are mine (checking: these cars are **cars** of mine)

  > Result: These cars belong to me

- Esses carros são os meus = These cars are mine (checking: these cars are **the cars** of mine)

  > Result: These cars are the ones that belong to me

Using the article in these cases talks about "extra specific" things, suggesting there are probably other possibilities.
