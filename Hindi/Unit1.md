## The Devanagari Script

Hindi has a long and interesting history. The immense evolution of North Indian culture can easily be seen in how the language has developed. It has had more than one script (writing system) used for the written language. At the time of India's independence, article 343 of the Indian constitution stated that "the official language of the Union [of India] (since India was considered a union of various unrelated states at that time) should become Hindi in **Devanagari script**." This variety of Hindi is called **Modern Standard Hindi**, which you will learn through this course.

The Devanagari script is an **abugida**, i.e. it consists of individual ‘units’ that represent a single vowel sound along with a few supporting consonant sounds.

- Each unit consists of a base consonant which is written *fully*.
- The vowel sound *followed by* the base consonant is expressed as a **vowel mark** (which can be understood as a *diacritic*, somewhat like the accents in European languages).

## वर्णमाला varṇamālā (Hindi's The Alphabet)

The order in which Hindi letters are memorised and generally presented is called the **वर्णमाला (garland of letters)**. Both vowels and consonants are divided into groups, where each one is characterised by the placement of the tongue in the mouth. The groups are presented in an order where the tongue placement moves from the posterior to the anterior part of the buccal cavity.

First, let's learn all letters in their distinct forms. Hindi has 11 vowels. 9 of them are:

| manner of articulation | short   | long    |
|:---------------------- |:------- |:------- |
| guttural               | **अ** a | **आ** ā |
| palatal                | **इ** i | **ई** ī |
| labial                 | **उ** u | **ऊ** ū |
| retroflex              | **ऋ** ṛ | -       |

- **अ** a - like the **u** in f**u**n.
- **आ** ā - like the **a** in f**a**ther.
- **इ** i - like the **i** in p**i**t.
- **ई** ī - like the **ee** in f**ee**t.
- **उ** u - like the **oo** in b**oo**k.
- **ऊ** ū - like the **ui** in s**ui**t.
- **ऋ** ṛ - this vowel does not have a wide usage in Hindi and was more significant in Sanskrit - Hindi's parent language. Its correct pronunciation has not been retained by Hindi. Nowadays, it is pronounced like the **ri** in b**ri**ck. (Sanskrit also had a long version of ऋ - the ॠ ṝ, which is a tale history seldom recites)
- **ए** ē - This is something like the **ea** in br**ea**k, albeit more uninterrupted, and is not followed by the short *i* sound as in English.
- **ऐ** ai - Originally, it was supposed to be a diphthong: a short *a* followed by a short *i*. However, nowadays, it is mostly pronounced like the **a** in bl**a**ck with the mouth more closed than in English.

Hindi has 33 basic consonants. Some of the **plosives** (sounds which are produced when the tongue hits any location in the mouth and restricts all the airflow) are:

| manner of articulation | uv. ua. | uv. a.   | v. ua.  | v. a.    | nasal        |
|:---------------------- |:------- |:-------- |:------- |:-------- |:------------ |
| guttural               | **क** k | **ख** kh | **ग** g | **घ** gh | **ङ** ṅ (ng) |

(**uv.** - unvoiced, **v.** - voiced, **ua.** - unaspirated, **a.** - aspirated)

- The nasal **ङ** ṅ is *never* written in Modern Standard Hindi.
- Hindi has two sets of similar-sounding consonants - the unaspirated and the aspirated consonants. Aspiration refers to the quality of certain sounds which make you feel a puff of air coming out of your mouth while pronouncing them. When you say **can**, you feel the puff of air while pronouncing the **c** sound. On the other hand, you don’t feel it while pronouncing the **k** sound in **park**. So, the first **/k/** sound is represented in Hindi through the aspirated **ख (kh)**, whereas as the second, through the unaspirated **क (k)**.

# Letters 2

Hindi has 33 basic consonants. More of the **plosives** (sounds which are produced when the tongue hits any location in the mouth and restricts all the airflow) are:

| m.o.a.   | uv. ua. | uv. a.   | v. ua.  | v. a.    | nasal        |
|:-------- |:------- |:-------- |:------- |:-------- |:------------ |
| guttural | **क** k | **ख** kh | **ग** g | **घ** gh | **ङ** ṅ (ng) |
| platal   | **च** c | **छ** ch | **ज** j | **झ** jh | **ञ** ñ      |
| dental   | **त** t | **थ** th | **द** d | **ध** dh | **न** n      |

(**m.o.a.** - manner of articulation, **uv.** - unvoiced, **v.** - voiced, **ua.** - unaspirated, **a.** - aspirated)

# Letters 3

## More Vowels:

| manner of articulation | long    | dipthong |
|:---------------------- |:------- |:-------- |
| palatoguttural         | **ए** ē | **ऐ** ai |
| labioguttural          | **ओ** ō | **औ** au |

- **ओ** ō - This is something like the **o** in j**o**ke, albeit more uninterrupted, and is not followed by the short *u* as in English.
- **औ** au - Originally, it was supposed to be a diphthong: a short *a* followed by a short *u*. However, today it is mostly pronounced like the **o** in bl**o**ck with the mouth more closed than in English.

## Diacritics

Vowels lend their sounds to consonants through vowel marks which are written *around* the base consonant. Taking **क** (k) as an example, vowel marks are added to consonants as follows:

| Vowel    | Vowel Mark | Compound   |
|:-------- |:---------- |:---------- |
| **अ** a  |            | **क** ka   |
| **आ** ā  | **ा**      | **का** kā  |
| **इ** i  | **ि**      | **कि** ki  |
| **ई** ī  | **ी**      | **की** kī  |
| **उ** u  | **ु**      | **कु** ku  |
| **ऊ** ū  | **ू**      | **कू** kū  |
| **ऋ** ṛ  | **ृ**      | **कृ** kṛ  |
| **ए** ē  | **े**      | **के** kē  |
| **ऐ** ai | **ै**      | **कै** kai |
| **ओ** ō  | **ो**      | **को** kō  |
| **औ** au | **ौ**      | **कौ** kau |

**IMPORTANT FEATURES OF DEVANAGARI**

- When there is no visible vowel mark, the unit so formed has the basic *a* sound. All consonants inherit the *a* sound by default. E.g., ख (kha), ग (ga).
- At the end of words, if a consonant has this inherent *a* sound, it is dropped. This is known as [schwa syncope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwa_deletion_in_Indo-Aryan_languages). E.g., पग (pag, not pa-ga), किताब (ki-tāb, not ki-tā-ba), कब (kab).
- Schwa syncope sometimes also happens at the middle of words. This happens when the schwa (**a**) to be deleted follows a consonant that comes at the end of a syllable. When this case of the schwa syncope happens needs to be memorised. E.g. लड़का (lad-kā, not la-da-kā).
- The **anunāsik ँ** symbol nasalises vowels. However, for most vowel marks, viz. ि, ी, े, ै, ो, and ौ, the **anusvār ं** symbol is used instead. This is probably because it's inconvenient to write such elaborate symbols in small spaces.
- To strip consonants off the schwa, a diacritic known as the **हलंत halant** ( **्**) is used. E.g., क् (k).

# Letters 4

Hindi has 33 basic consonants. The remaining **plosives** (sounds which are produced when the tongue hits any location in the mouth and restricts all the air flow) are:

| m.o.a.    | uv. ua. | uv. a.   | v. ua.  | v. a.    | nasal        |
|:--------- |:------- |:-------- |:------- |:-------- |:------------ |
| guttural  | **क** k | **ख** kh | **ग** g | **घ** gh | **ङ** ṅ (ng) |
| platal    | **च** c | **छ** ch | **ज** j | **झ** jh | **ञ** ñ      |
| retroflex | **ट** ṭ | **ठ** ṭh | **ड** ḍ | **ढ** ḍh | **ण** ṇ      |
| dental    | **त** t | **थ** th | **द** d | **ध** dh | **न** n      |
| labial    | **प** p | **फ** ph | **ब** b | **भ** bh | **म** m      |

(**m.o.a.** - manner of articulation, **uv.** - unvoiced, **v.** - voiced, **ua.** - unaspirated, **a.** - aspirated)

**Others:**

| manner of articulation | semi-vowels | fricatives |
|:---------------------- |:----------- |:---------- |
| guttural               | -           | **ह** h    |
| platal                 | **य** y     | **श** ś    |
| retroflex              | **र** r     | **ष** ṣ    |
| dental                 | **ल** l     | **स** s    |
| labial                 | **व** v     | -          |

(**semivowels** allow the flow of some amount of air, **fricatives** force air out of a small space created in the mouth during articulation)

Additional Consonants:

- **ड़** - This is a *trilled* version of ड ḍ, somewhat like the **tt** of bu**tt**er in American English, but retroflexed!
- **ढ़** - Trilled version of ढ ḍh.

Loan consonants:

- **ज़** z - English/Persian
- **फ़** f - English/Persian
- **क़** q - Persian. Almost like क k, pronounced with the epiglottis. (Arabic ق)
- **ग़** g - Persian. Almost like ग g, pronounced with the epiglottis. (Arabic غ)
- Retroflexed and dental consonants might sound the same to non-native ears, but the former is typical of Indian languages and consists of *hard-sounding* consonants which are produced by curling and pushing the tip of the tongue back inside the mouth, while the latter are simple dental consonants found in Romance languages like Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, etc.
- To strip consonants off the schwa, a diacritic known as the **हलंत halant** ( **्**) is used. E.g., क् (k).

## Conjunct Consonants

When two or more consonants, some of which do not have a vowel following them, are placed directly next to each other, the tongue requires instantaneously shifting its position. This is represented in Hindi through conjunct consonants. E.g. नम**स्ते** (namastē). This word can be broken down as: **न (na) + म (ma) + स (sa) + ् (delete preceding a) + ते (tē)**, where the conjunct consonant is **स्त sta** (स + ् + त). Notice that because of the *halant*, the स (sa) gets modified, and only half of it is written, while the remaining part is attached to the following त (ta). Many such conjunct consonants can exist, and the letter modifications follow a general pattern:

- Consonants that have a vertical line at the extreme *right* notice its disappearance. E.g., स्त sta (स् s + त ta), स्न sna (स् s + न na), न्य nya (न् n + य ya), ग्घ ggha (ग् g + घ gha), त्थ ttha (त् t + थ th), etc.
- Consonants that have a vertical line, albeit restricted to the centre, require the *curl* at the right to extend to the following consonant. E.g., क्ख kkha (क् k + ख kha), फ्या phyā (फ् ph + या yā).
- According to modern norms, all other kinds of consonants do not show a modification but follow a simple **consonant + halant + consonant** format. E.g., ट्क ṭka. Various other conjunct combinations exist, many of which are no longer used in official documents but continue to be used in some other places. At places where they are not used, the **consonant + halant + consonant** format is used.
- Nasal consonants that are vowel-less before another consonant are represented by the **anusvār ं** symbol. E.g., संघ saṅgh (स sa + ङ् ṅ + घ gh[a]), पंच pañc (as in English *punch*) (प pa + ञ् ñ + च c[a]), खंड khaṇḍ (ख kha + ण् ṇ + ड ḍ[a]), बंद band (ब ba + न् n + द d[a]), नींबू nīmbū (नी nī + म् m + बू bū), which would historically be written as सङ्घ, पञ्च, खण्ड, बन्द, and नीम्बू respectively.
- Some special characters exist for a few consonant combinations, viz. क्ष kṣa (क् k + ष ṣa), त्र tra (त् t + र ra), and ज्ञ jña (ज् j + ञ ña). **ज्ञ**, however, is pronounced exactly like ग्य gya.

## The irregular र

र follows different rules in conjunct combinations.

|            | र् + X                    | X + ् + र                       |
|:---------- |:------------------------- |:------------------------------- |
| E.g.       | **पार्क** pārk            | प्रदेश pra-dēś                  |
| break down | पा pā + **र् r + क k**[a] | **प् p + र ra** + दे ē + श ś[a] |

The second case involves writing the र like a *slash* symbol below the vowel-less consonant. E.g. प्र pra, क्र kra, द्र dra, घ्र ghra. The first case involves writing the र् like a small **C** above the following consonant. E.g. र्प rpa, र्क rka, र्द rda, र्घ rgha.

# Basics 1

## पहले पाठ में आपका स्वागत है! Welcome to the first lesson!

**इतिहास itihās - History**

Hindi is an **Indo-Aryan** language, meaning it stems from Sanskrit. Naturally, a major part of Hindi vocabulary finds its roots in **Sanskrit**.
However, the Mughal influence (of *Persianised* rulers) has lent several **Persian** (particularly old Persian), **Arabic**, and **Turkish** vocabulary to Hindi.
Hindi has also only recently undergone another gradual, albeit intentionally designed change the last few hundred years: *Sanskritisation*. This term refers to the use of words (called **तत्सम tatsam** words: **तत् tat** - there, **सम sam** - same; meaning exactly the same as in Sanskrit) which are straight away picked up from Classical Sanskrit to be used in official, formal occasions while speaking Hindi. This should not be confused with the Sanskrit vocabulary that has evolved over long periods of time and now forms the base of the language.
Other than that, Hindi has a plethora of **English** (and occasionally **Portuguese**) loanwords.

**शब्दावली shabdāvalī - Vocabulary**

Summarising the previous paragraph, the four basic origins for Hindi words are:

- **Evolved Sanskrit** - most general grammatical rules are followed by this category of words, including identification of any word’s gender.
- **Persian** - most general grammatical rules are *not* followed by this category of words and have to be remembered by heart, most noticeably their gender.
- **Classical Sanskrit** (formal) - these words generally have different rules for very simple grammatical concepts than those for Evolved Sanskrit words.
- **European** - they mostly follow the general grammatical rules of Evolved Sanskrit words.

This information will be used further in these tips and notes.

## लिंग liṅg - Gender

All Hindi **nouns**, **verbs**, and **adjectives** have a gender. There are two genders in Hindi - **masculine (m.)** and **feminine (f.)**. There are a few ways to guess a word’s gender based on its origin:

- **Evolved Sanskrit:** *most* words that end with an **आ ā** sound are masculine (पंखा paṅkh**ā** - fan, m.), while *most* words that end with an **ई ī** sound are feminine (नदी nad**ī** - river, f.). Moreover, words that end with a consonant sound are masculine (घर gha**r** - house, m.) and those which end in **या yā** are feminine (चिड़िया ciṛi**yā** - bird, f.)

|              | masculine | feminine  |
|:------------ |:--------- |:--------- |
| ending vowel | **ा/आ ā** | **ी/ई ī** |
| ending sound | consonant | **या yā** |

- **Persian:** Persian is a genderless language. So, there is no fixed way of identifying the gender of Persian loanwords in Hindi. They have to be learnt by heart. E.g. आदमी ādmī – man (m.), ख़्याल xyāl (m.), हवा havā (f.). In fact, there are instances when both Persian derived and Evolved Sanskrit words that have different genders are used for the same thing, e.g. Sanskrit छाया chāyā (f., according to the table above) and Persian साया sāyā (m., contrary to the table), both of which mean *shadow*.
- **Classical Sanskrit:** Generally, all Classical Sanskrit loanwords that end in a consonant sound are masculine (संकल्प saṅkalp - oath, m.), and all other words that end in any vowel sound are feminine (सुविधा suvidhā - service, f.; प्रगति pragati – progress, f.).
- **European:** these words are generally assigned a gender based on the gender of the actual Hindi word. E.g. **स्कूल skool** (school) is masculine, since the Hindi word **विद्यालय vidyālay** (school) is masculine.

## होना hōnā - to be

Like most languages, the verb *be* is the most irregular in Hindi. However, *all* Hindi verbs require it in some or the other form as an auxiliary verb for basic conjugation. This means that you’ll find this verb in some or the other form attached to *every* other verb.

When used as an auxiliary verb, it has the simplest conjugation:

| Pronoun (Eng.)             | Pronoun (Hindi)   | होना hōnā    | be  |
|:-------------------------- |:----------------- |:------------ |:--- |
| **I** (1st person)         | **मैं** maim̐     | **हूँ** hūm̐ | am  |
| **He/She/It** (3rd person) | **यह/वह** yah/vah | **है** hai   | is  |

## Pronouns - यह yah, वह vah

Notice that Hindi has only two words for third person pronouns:

| Pronoun    | Usage                                                                                                                                   |
|:---------- |:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **यह** yah | Gender-Neutral Pronoun, meaning he, she, it, or this (used when the person/thing is somewhere close or if you’re pointing towards them) |
| **वह** vah | Gender-Neutral Pronoun, meaning he, she, it, or that (used when the person/thing is at a distance or not present in the scene)          |

Often, यह (yah) is pronounced as *yē* and वह (vah) is pronounced as *vō* colloquially. In formal and literary contexts, these colloquial pronunciations are considered incorrect.

## Articles

Definite articles do not exist in Hindi. This means that there is no translation for "the" in Hindi. If the situation demands a strong specification, demonstrative articles are used (this, that). In Hindi, **यह yah** and **वह vah** also act like this and that respectively.

# Basics 2

## namastē all the way

नमस्ते namastē is a super versatile greeting which can be used for saying hello or goodbye to people. Hindi also doesn’t make use of phrases like good morning, goodnight, and so on frequently. नमस्ते namastē is also used in place of those.

Even though Hindi uses धन्यवाद dhanyavād (thank you), there is no direct translation for “you’re welcome”. In place of that, you could hear phrases like “doesn’t matter”, “it was my duty” or “don’t be so extra” (in Hindi of course) on Indian streets.

## talking about yourself

Remember from Basics 2 that verbs have gender in Hindi, which means that they tell us about whether the subject is masculine or feminine. So, when you’re talking about yourself, you’ll use your verbs according to your gender.

Also, remember that Hindi verbs have three parts: the verb root (the actual verb), the suffix (a word-ending which tells us about the gender), and the auxiliary verb (some form of the verb होना hōnā - to be, which tells us about when the action happened). For the first person, I, these are:

| Pronoun (English) | Pronoun (Hindi) | Suffix (m.) | Suffix (f.) | होना hōnā         |
|:----------------- |:--------------- |:----------- |:----------- |:----------------- |
| I                 | **मैं** maim̐   | –**ता** tā  | –**ती** tī  | **हूँ** hūm̐ (am) |
| You               | तुम tum         | –ते tē      | –ती tī      | हो hō (are)       |
| He/She            | यह yah/वह vah   | –ता tā      | –ती tī      | है hai (is)       |

(You and He/She have also been included for comparison. **Notice** that the **suffixes** for **I** and **He/She** are the same. Moreover, feminine suffixes are the exact same for all three.)

Taking **खाना** khānā [to eat] as an example, it is conjugated as:

| Pronoun (English) | Pronoun (Hindi) | खाना (m.)               | खाना (f.)               |
|:----------------- |:--------------- |:----------------------- |:----------------------- |
| I                 | **मैं** maim̐   | **खाता हूँ** khātā hūm̐ | **खाती हूँ** khātī hūm̐ |
| You               | तुम tum         | खाते हो khātē hō        | खाती हो khātī hō        |
| He/She            | यह yah/वह vah   | खाता है khātā hai       | खाती है khātī hai       |

E.g. **I eat** an apple. = **मैं** सेब **खाता हूँ**। **maim̐** sēb **khātā hum̐**

(Remember that verbs come *after* the object, which is the person or thing on which an action is being done, unlike English. Also, notice that a male would say this sentence and that sentences end with a पूर्ण विराम pūrṇ virām - ।, instead of a full stop or period in Hindi.)

Remember that the ँ simply nasalises the preceding vowel. It is written as a ं on the vowel marks ि, ी, े, ै, ो and ौ. When transliterated, ‘m̐’ is used to represent this nasalisation.

## learn to say no

The word **नहीं nahīm̐** is used for both No as an answer to a question, and in sentences of negation in the form of **not** or **don’t**. It is always placed just before the verb.

E.g. मैं पानी **नहीं पीती हूँ**। maim̐ pānī **nahīm̐ pītī hūm̐** - I **don’t drink** water. (Notice that a female would say this sentence)

Moreover, in both colloquial and formal situations, the auxiliary verb होना hōnā *can* be dropped. This means that the above sentence can also be - मैं पानी **नहीं पीती**। maim̐ pānī **nahīm̐ pītī** - I **don’t drink** water. This means that both sentences are fully valid and equally used. The placement of नहीं nahīm̐ can get somewhat complex with phrasal verbs that will be taught later on. Hopefully, it won’t be as difficult as saying no in real life.

# Introduction

## Postpositions

Just like English has prepositions (certain words placed before nouns and pronouns that give meaning about their activity, for example, at, by, from, on, in, etc.), Hindi has **postpositions**. These are responsible for the third most challenging grammatical aspect of Hindi as mentioned in [Tips and Notes for Basics 1](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/hi/Basics-1/tips-and-notes) – the oblique case. The oblique case is a *case*, i.e. it refers to the small changes (called *inflections* in the world of linguistics) made at the end of nouns and pronouns when a postposition is placed after them. However, this lesson teaches those sentences which do not require the oblique case, and hence, it will be dealt with in later lessons.

So, unlike English, any (usually smaller, monosyllable) word that describes a noun’s activity or description is placed *after* it (**post**-position). For example:

Raj is **in India** - राज **भारत में** है
Here, the postposition में (in) is placed after भारत (India).

When used with a different verb:

Raj studies **in India** and Julia studies **in America**. - राज **भारत में** पढ़ता है और जूलिया **अमेरिका में** पढ़ती है।

## Possessives

Words denoting possession are also gendered in Hindi. Possessive pronouns are generally different words altogether, while an equivalent of **’s** (का/की/के) is used for other nouns in Hindi.

**However**, there is a difference. The gender and number of possessive pronouns agrees with the gender and number of the *object* and not the subject. This means that मेरा (my - masculine), for example, is used when the object the first person possesses is masculine, and *not* that that person is male.

**Singular-Object Possessive Pronouns:**

| Pronoun        | m. obj. | f. obj. |
|:-------------- |:------- |:------- |
| मैं (I)        | मेरा    | मेरी    |
| तू (you)       | तेरा    | तेरी    |
| वह (he/she/it) | उसका    | उसकी    |
| यह (he/she/it) | इसका    | इसकी    |

For example,

- My name - मेरा नाम (**नाम** m.)
- Her house - उसका घर (**घर** m.)
- His book - उसकी किताब (**किताब** f.)
- Its eye - उसकी आँख (**आँख** f.)

**का/की – Hindi Equivalent of *Apostrophe S* (‘s):**

| Possessive Particle | m. obj. | f. obj |
|:------------------- |:------- |:------ |
| ‘s                  | का      | की     |

For example,

- Neha’s book – नेहा की किताब (**किताब** f.)
- Neha’s apple – नेहा का सेब (**सेब** m.)

# Family

## The Oblique Case

As mentioned [before](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/hi/Introduction/tips-and-notes), the oblique case is a *case*. This means that its ending differs from the normal form (called the **nominative case**). A word’s oblique case depends on its gender and number (again), and terminal sound.

**Singular:**

| Ending        | Gender | Repl.     | Add. |
|:------------- |:------ |:--------- |:---- |
| **ा** (आ)     | masc.  | **े** (ए) | -    |
| anything else | masc.  | -         | -    |
| any ending    | fem.   | -         | -    |

**Plural:**

| Ending               | Gender    | Repl.           | Add.        |
|:-------------------- |:--------- |:--------------- |:----------- |
| **े** (ए)            | masc. pl. | **ों** (ओं)     | -           |
| **ि** (इ)/ **ी** (ई) | masc. pl. | **ियों (इयों)** | -           |

(**Obl.** - Oblique Case)

**How are plural masculine words and singular oblique case variants differentiated between?** Answer – through context.

(that’s language)

**Example:** के**ले** में – In the banana

Whenever a doer or receiver of a verb takes the oblique case, all the descriptive words attached to it take the oblique case as well (since all those words together are considered the subject/object).

**Example:** मे**रे** के**ले** में – In my banana
Here, the subject is मेरा केला (my banana), and hence, both मेरा and केला take the oblique case.

का/की also influence the preceding entity to take the oblique case.

**Example:**

- मे**रे** ब**च्चे** का नाम पीटर है – My child’s name is Peter
- मे**रे** के**लों** में - In my bananas
- मे**रे** घर में ते**रे** घर का पानी है – There is your house’s water in my house (घर – m. house)

## Third Form of You – आप

**Verb Conjugation:**

| Pronoun          | Suffix (m.) | Suffix (f.) | Aux. Verb होना       |
|:---------------- |:----------- |:----------- |:-------------------- |
| **आप** (you)     | **ते** *te* | **ती** *tī* | **हैं** *hain* (are) |
| **हम** (we)      | **ते** *te* | **ती** *tī* | **हैं** *hain* (are) |
| **ये/वे** (they) | **ते** *te* | **ती** *tī* | **हैं** *hain* (are) |

(The conjugations of ये/वे and हम are the same as those for आप)

(Possessive pronouns are pluralised using the regular rule; plural feminine objects show no change.)

(The oblique case form of all plural possessive pronouns show no change as an exception)

| sing.          | m. obj.  | f. obj.  | m. pl. obj. | pl. Pronoun   | m. obj.  | f. obj.  | m. pl. obj. |
|:-------------- |:-------- |:-------- |:----------- |:------------- |:-------- |:-------- |:----------- |
| मैं (I)        | मेरा     | मेरी     | मेरे        | हम (we)       | हमारा    | हमारी    | हमारे       |
| तुम (you)      | तुम्हारा | तुम्हारी | तुम्हारे    | तुम (you all) | तुम्हारा | तुम्हारी | तुम्हारे    |
| आप (you)       | आपका     | आपकी     | आपके        | आप (you all)  | आपका     | आपकी     | आपके        |
| तू (you)       | तेरा     | तेरी     | तेरे        | -             | -        | -        | -           |
| वह (he/she/it) | उसका     | उसकी     | उसके        | वे (they)     | उनका     | उनकी     | उनके        |
| यह (he/she/it) | इसका     | इसकी     | इसके        | ये (they)     | इनका     | इनकी     | इनके        |

## Formality and Respect

In formal situations and for respected people (including all elders), plural versions are used in every context. For example, with पिता (father): मे**रे** पिता भारत में **हैं** - My father is in India; उस**के** पिता अमेरिका से नहीं **हैं** - His father is not from America.

## Possession with अपना/अपनी/अपने

In Hindi, sentences like “I eat my apple” seem too redundant (मैं मेरा सेब खाता हूँ). So, a class of three different words are used to *replace possessive pronouns when their (pro)noun has been mentioned before*.

अपना is used for masculine singular objects, अपनी for female singular or plural objects, and अपने for masculine plural objects. **Example:**

- मैं **अपना** सेब खाता हूँ। – I eat my apple.
- तुम **अपनी** किताब पढ़ती हो। - You read your book.

Sometimes, these words can also be used when their noun or pronoun is obvious from the context. For example, when a kid comes up to you, you might ask them “अपना नाम बताओ” – Tell me your name (बताओ – imperative form of *tell*), where it is obvious that अपना means *your* (Notice that *me* is not required in such a sentence).

These words also take up the oblique case. For example, वह अपने घर से आती है – She comes from her home (आना - *to come*; अपना घर changes to अपने घर because of से - *from*).

## Adjectives

We learnt how अपना/अपनी/अपने and मेरा/मेरी/मेरे work and how they are used depending on the object's gender and number. Let's name this *system of three forms of a single word* the **आ/ई/ए system**, which explains that adjective-like words (including all possessive pronouns, adverbs, and so on) that end with:

- **ा (आ)** are used for **singular masculine** objects. (the oblique case of which use the े (ए) ending)
- **ी (ई)** are used for **singular and plural feminine** objects. (the oblique case of which show no change)
- **े (ए)** are used for **plural masculine** objects. (the oblique case of which shows no change)

For example, **My**:

| Obj. Gender | Obj. Number | Nominative Case | Oblique Case |
|:----------- |:----------- |:--------------- |:------------ |
| masculine   | singular    | मेरा            | मेरे         |
| feminine    | sing./pl.   | मेरी            | मेरी         |
| masculine   | plural      | मेरे            | मेरे         |

All adjectives use the आ/ई/ए system unless they end with consonants. Adjectives, as in English, are placed **before the (pro)noun**.

For example:

- बड़ा केला - big banana, बड़ी किताब - big book, बड़े बच्चे - big (mature) children.
- मेरे बड़े भाई का बेटा - My big (elder) brother's son (usage of oblique case).

## होना - The Habitual Form

We have learnt the हूँ, हो, है, हैं forms of होना. However, along with these (default) forms, होना can be conjugated just like other verbs in the simple present.

(मैं) होता/होती हूँ, (तुम) होते/होती हो, (यह/वह) होता/होती है, etc.

These forms can be referred to as the habitual form, as they are used when *be* is expressed in a way which represents a phenomenon that already exists and will continue to exist in the future.

For example:

- बिल्लियाँ छोटी होती हैं (छोटी – small) – Cats are small
- केले पीले होते हैं (पीले – yellow) – Bananas are yellow
