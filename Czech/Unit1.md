# Hello: Phrases & Introductions

In this skill we learn how to greet or introduce someone, say our name, say "yes", "no", "please", "excuse me", "thank you", and "I do not understand". After "Jitka" and "Jakub" from the first skill, we get introduced to two more people by name, "Kateřina" and "Matěj". Please do not translate personal names to English in this course.

## Cultural item

The most common greeting in Czech polite enough to greet complete strangers with during daytime is "Dobrý den!". No single English greeting exactly matches it. The literal translation "Good day!" in most of the English speaking world is for leave-taking, unlike the Czech greeting. "Good morning!" and "Good afternoon!" are both too limited as to period of applicability. In this course we settled on showing "Dobrý den!" translated as "Hello!".

## Grammar bits

We learn **"já jsem"** ("I am"). You can use it to introduce yourself:

- Já jsem Matěj. (I am Matěj.)

We also learn the ubiquitous word **"to"**. You can use it along with "je" from the previous skill to introduce or point out someone else:

- To je Kateřina. (That/This/She is Kateřina.)

Time to get into more Czech sounds.

## Vowels

This should mostly be a review:

- **a** is always like the "a" in "father", never like the "a" in "dad".
- **e** is as in "set".
- **i** is as in "sit".
- **y** is always a vowel, never a consonant, and sounds the same as **i**.
- **o** is as in "gopher" in American English, but without the light *w* sound which usually follows it, or as in the British pronunciation of "lot".
- **u** is as in "put".

Each vowel has a short and a long form, the long forms generally being written with the accent like the "á" in **"máma"**. The main difference between a short vowel and a long vowel is the length of time spent pronouncing them, except that **i** and **y** also undergo a quality change, possibly variable by region:

- **í** and **ý** sound as the "ea" in "seat".

We do get a new vowel letter:

- **ě** always follows a consonant. It is pronounced just like **e** but changes the pronunciation of the consonant just before it. See the final note below.

## Consonants

We meet a few more consonants in this skill.

Many consonants occur in pairs, voiced and unvoiced, like **b** and **p**, **d** and **t**, **z** and **s**, or **ž** and **š**. Some consonants are not paired up (like **m** and **n**), and some (like **r**) don't fit into either category too well.

### Voiced

- **b** is as in English
- **d** is mostly as in English but pronounced with the tongue closer to the teeth.
- **ď** is a sound that does not exist in English. It sounds roughly like a **d** followed by the consonantal English "y", but merged into a single sound. Some of you may want to think about it as a sound between a **d** and a **g**.
- **g** is as in English (not used much in Czech by spelling, but very common as the voiced pronunciation of **k**).
- **h** is like the "h" in "hotel".
- **z** is as in English.
- **ž** is like the sound that the "s" makes in "pleasure".

### Unvoiced

- **c** represents a sound that doesn't quite exist in English, but it is close to how the "ts" at the end of "cats" sounds. It is much closer to a single sound rather than a sequence of two.
- **č** is like the "ch" in "chicken".
- **k** and **p** are as in English, but a bit less explosive.
- **s** is as in English.
- **t** is as in English, but with the tongue closer to the teeth and less explosive.
- **ť** is the unvoiced mate of **ď**, and is similarly a sound which does not exist in English. It sounds roughly like a **t** followed by the consonantal English "y", but merged into one sound rather than a sequence of two. (Or try a sound between a **t** and a **k**.)

### Other

- **j** is like the "y" in "yellow".
- **l** is as in English.
- **m** and **n** are as in English.
- **ň** is roughly like an **n** followed by the consonantal English "y", but it is one sound rather than a sequence of two. (Just think Spanish "ma**ñ**ana".)
- **r** is lightly rolled, as in Spanish or Italian, or tapped, as in Scots, but never growled.
- **ř** is a sound unique to Czech and is a sound the majority of foreigners and some natives find difficult to learn. It's roughly something between **r** and **ž**.

## Combinations

As noted previously, each letter in Czech is usually pronounced independently of any letters which precede or follow it, with important exceptions individually noted in these tips.

- If a word begins "js", like **"jsem"**, there can be little evidence of the **j** in its pronunciation.
- The letter **ě** is pronounced depending on what consonant it follows. When it follows **d** or **t**, the pronunciation changes the consonant to a **d'** or **t'** (resp.) followed by a plain **e**. Compare the sound of "dě" in **"děkuju"** with that of "de" in **"dobrý den"**, and the sound of "tě" in **"Matěj"** with that of "te" in **"Kateřina"**.

# Descriptions: Masculine

In this skill we learn a few words to describe people and things and get to see the grammatical gender in action.

Every noun in Czech has a gender: masculine, feminine, or neuter. Knowing the gender is important for choosing the form of the noun and even other words in the sentence. For inanimate nouns, there is little relation between their gender and their nature. For example **"čaj"** (tea) is masculine, **"káva"** (coffee) is feminine, and **"mléko"** (milk) is neuter. For nouns that refer to people, the grammatical gender and biological sex usually do coincide.

It may be possible to guess the gender of the noun from its ending:

- Nouns ending in a **consonant** are mostly masculine. Early examples include **"kluk"** (boy), **"muž"** (man), **"chléb"** (bread), **"čaj"** (tea), and the proper names **"František"**, **"Jakub"**, and **"Matěj"**.
- Nouns ending in **-a** or **-e** are mostly feminine. Early examples include **"holka"** (girl), **"žena"** (woman, wife), **"restaurace"** (restaurant), **"lžíce"** (spoon), and the proper names **"Jitka"**, **"Kateřina"**, and **"Žofie"**.
- Nouns ending in **-o** are almost always neuter. Early examples include **město** (city), **"auto"** (car), **"jablko"** (apple), and **"maso"** (meat).
- Nouns that end in **-ě** or **-í** are also often neuter. Early examples include **"dítě"** (child), **"letiště"** (airport), and **"náměstí"** (square, plaza).

Unfortunately, many nouns do not conform. Let's list a few taken from our early skills:

- Some nouns that end in a consonant are feminine, e.g., **"věc"** (thing), **"sůl"** (salt), **"mrkev"** (carrot), **"myš"** (mouse), and **"postel"** (bed).
- Some nouns that end in **-a** are masculine, e.g., **"táta"** (dad) and **"turista"** (tourist).
- Some nouns that end in **-e** are neuter, e.g., **"zvíře"** (animal) and **"vejce"** (egg).

## Adjectives

We encountered our very first Czech adjective in the previous skill as part of the **"dobrý den"** greeting. This adjective and others like it have endings that depend on the gender of the noun they modify:

- **-ý** in masculine, e.g., **"dobrý čaj"** (good tea)
- **-á** in feminine, e.g., **"dobrá káva"** (good coffee)
- **-é** in neuter, e.g., **"dobré mléko"** (good milk)

The adjectives we will be using in this skill (listed in their masculine forms) are:

- **"dobrý"** (good)
- **"malý"** (little, small)
- **"mladý"** (young)
- **"nový"** (new)
- **"starý"** (old)
- **"velký"** (big, large)

## Demonstratives

Czech doesn't have articles, so **"mladý muž"** could be "young man", "a young man", or "the young man", depending on context. Czech has a variety of ways of making clear which is meant when the distinction is important, including the word order. Here we only examine the demonstrative adjective (technically pronoun, but used before its noun like an adjective) that is sometimes used in place of the definite article. This demonstrative has the following forms:

- **"ten"** in masculine, e.g., **"ten muž"** (the/that man)
- **"ta"** in feminine, e.g., **"ta žena"** (the/that woman)
- **"to"** in neuter, e.g., **"to dítě"** (the/that child)

Demonstrative adjectives and regular adjectives can usually be combined, in that order: **"ten starý muž"** (the/that old man).

## Pronunciation notes

The comments below build on the tips provided with the first two skills. Please review them as needed.

Several new consonants matter in this skill:

- **ch** is considered a single letter in Czech and is found after "h" in dictionaries. It is the unvoiced counterpart to **h**. The sound no longer exists in most dialects of English. Scots has retained it, for example in "Loch Ness".
- **dž** is not a single letter, but this cluster is pronounced like the "j" in "juice". It is the voiced counterpart to **č**.
- **f** is as in English (and an unvoiced counterpart to **v**).
- **š** is like the "sh" in "sheep" (and an unvoiced counterpart to **ž**).
- **v** is as in English. It is voiced.
- **ž** is like the sound that the "s" makes in "pleasure". It is voiced.

The **"ti"** in **"František"** gives us an example of another pronunciation interference between letters:

- In domestic Czech words, when followed by an **i** or **í**, **d** is pronounced like **ď**, **t** like **ť**, and **n** like **ň**.

This skill also includes two more examples of the final consonant devoicing, when a voiced consonant at the end of a word is pronounced as if it were devoiced (unless followed in the stream of speech by another voiced consonant):

- The **"b"** at the end of **"chléb"** gets pronounced as its devoiced mate "p", making the word sound like *"chlép"*.
- The **"ž"** at the end of **"muž"** gets pronounced as its devoiced mate "š", making the word sound like *"muš"* (*moosh*).

# Descriptions: Feminine

Every noun in Czech has a gender, which can be "masculine", "feminine", or "neuter". Knowing the gender is important because it impacts the form of the noun and even other words in the sentence. For inanimate things, there is little relation between their gender and their nature. For example **"čaj"** (tea) is masculine, **"káva"** (coffee) is feminine, and **"mléko"** (milk) is neuter. For words that refer to people, the grammatical gender and biological sex usually do coincide.

It may be possible to guess the gender of the noun from its ending:

- Nouns ending in a **consonant** are mostly masculine. Other examples include **"kluk"** (boy), **"muž"** (man), **"chléb"** (bread), **"dům"** (house), **"míč"** (ball), and the proper names **"František"** and **"Matěj"**.
- Nouns ending in **-a** or **-e** are mostly feminine. Early examples include **"holka"** (girl), **"žena"** (woman, wife), **"restaurace"** (restaurant), **"lžíce"** (spoon), and the proper names **"Kateřina"** and **"Žofie"**.
- Nouns ending in **-o** are almost always neuter. Other examples include **město** (city), **"auto"** (car), **"jablko"** (apple), and **"maso"** (meat).
- Nouns that end in **-ě** or **-í** are also often neuter. Early examples include **"dítě"** (child), **"letiště"** (airport), and **"náměstí"** (square, plaza).

Unfortunately, many nouns do not conform. Let's list a few taken from our early skills:

- Some nouns that end in a consonant are feminine, e.g., **"věc"** (thing), **"sůl"** (salt), **"mrkev"** (carrot), **"myš"** (mouse), and **"postel"** (bed).
- Some nouns that end in **-a** are masculine, e.g., **"táta"** (dad) and **"turista"** (tourist).
- Some nouns that end in **-e** are neuter, e.g., **"zvíře"** (animal) and **"vejce"** (egg).

## Adjectives

We encountered our very first Czech adjective in the second skill as part of **"dobrý den"** (a polite greeting). This adjective and others like it have endings that depend on the gender as follows:

- **-ý** in masculine, e.g., **"dobrý čaj"** (good tea)
- **-á** in feminine, e.g., **"dobrá káva"** (good coffee)
- **-é** in neuter, e.g., **"dobré mléko"** (good milk)

The adjectives we will be using in this skill (listed in their feminine forms) are:

- **"dobrá"** (good)
- **"malá"** (little, small)
- **"mladá"** (young)
- **"nová"** (new)
- **"stará"** (old)
- **"velká"** (big, large)

## Demonstratives

Czech doesn't have articles, so **"mladá žena"** could be "young woman", "a young woman", or "the young woman", depending on context. Czech has a variety of ways for making it clear which is meant when the distinction is important, including the word order. Here we only examine the demonstrative adjective (technically pronoun, but used before its noun like an adjective) that is sometimes used in place of the definite article. This demonstrative has the following forms:

- **"ten"** in masculine, e.g., **"ten muž"** (the/that man)
- **"ta"** in feminine, e.g., **"ta žena"** (the/that woman)
- **"to"** in neuter, e.g., **"to dítě"** (the/that child)

Demonstrative adjectives and regular adjectives can usually be combined, in that order: **"ta mladá žena"** (the/that young woman).

## Pronunciation notes

The comments below build on the tips provided with the first two skills. Please make sure to review them as needed.

You may notice what appears to be a new vowel:

- **ů** is just a different spelling of the long **ú**. They sound the same. The rule is to spell as **ú** at the beginning of the word or of the word root following a prefix, and as **ů** otherwise.

Several new consonants appear in this skill:

- **c** represents a sound that doesn't quite exist in English, but it is very close to the "ts" at the end of "cats". It is, however, closer to a single sound rather than a sequence of two.
- **č** is like the "ch" in "chicken".
- **h** is like the "h" in "hotel". It is voiced.
- **l** is as in English.
- **v** is as in English. It is voiced.

This skill includes an example of a voiced consonant, **"v"**, appearing at the end of a word, **"mrkev"**. Such consonants are typically pronounced as if they were devoiced. The devoiced counterpart of "v" is "f", and so "mrkev" ends up sounding like *"mrkef"*, a word that does not really exist in Czech any other way.

The **"ni"** in **"kniha"** gives us an example of another pronunciation interference between letters:

- In domestic Czech words, when followed by an **i** or **í**, **d** is pronounced like **ď**, **t** like **ť**, and **n** like **ň**.

We have already seen that what consonant shows up before **ě** impacts the way the combination is pronounced:

- When **ě** follows **d**, **t**, or **n**, the pronunciation changes the consonant to a **d'**, **t'**, or **ň** (resp.) followed by a plain **e**.
- When **ě** follows any other consonant (excepting **m**), the consonant the **ě** is pronounced like the "y" in "yellow".

And that's why **"věc"** sounds like *"vyec"*.

# Descriptions: Neuter

In this skill we learn a few more words to describe people and things and get to see the grammatical gender in action.

Please read the introductory gender notes in the neighboring **Masculine** skill. We need to save space here.

## Adjectives

We encountered our very first Czech adjective in the second skill as part of **"dobrý den"** (a polite greeting). This adjective and others like it have endings that depend on the gender as follows:

- **-ý** in masculine, e.g., **"dobrý čaj"** (good tea)
- **-á** in feminine, e.g., **"dobrá káva"** (good coffee)
- **-é** in neuter, e.g., **"dobré mléko"** (good milk)

The adjectives we will be using in this skill (listed in their neuter forms) are:

- **"dobré"** (good)
- **"malé"** (little, small)
- **"mladé"** (young)
- **"nové"** (new)
- **"staré"** (old)
- **"velké"** (big, large)

## Demonstratives

Czech doesn't have articles, so **"malé dítě"** could be "small child", "a small child", or "the small child", depending on context. Czech has a variety of ways of making clear which is meant when the distinction is important, including the word order. Here we only examine the demonstrative adjective (technically pronoun, but used before its noun like an adjective) that is sometimes used in place of the definite article. This demonstrative has the following forms:

- **"ten"** in masculine, e.g., **"ten muž"** (the/that man)
- **"ta"** in feminine, e.g., **"ta žena"** (the/that woman)
- **"to"** in neuter, e.g., **"to dítě"** (the/that child)

Demonstrative adjectives and regular adjectives can usually be combined, in that order: **"to malé dítě"** (the/that small child).

## Pronunciation notes

The comments below build on the tips provided with the first two skills. Please make sure to review them as needed.

Vowel sequences are not too common in Czech and usually show up in foreign-derived words. The example in **"auto"** shows that the Czech approach to vowel sequences in the same syllable is to simply glide from the first vowel to the next.

Several new consonants appear in this skill:

- **c** represents a sound that doesn't quite exist in English, but it is very close to the "ts" at the end of "cats". It is, however, closer to a single sound rather than a sequence of two.
- **č** is like the "ch" in "chicken".
- **š** is like the "sh" in "sheep" (and an unvoiced counterpart to **ž**).
- **v** is as in English. It is voiced.
- **z** is as in English. It is voiced.
- **ž** is like the sound that the "s" makes in "pleasure".

This skill also includes examples of the **"mě"** sequence in **"město"** and **"náměstí"**. This is a good place to summarize the rules for pronouncing the Czech **ě** in general. The pronunciation effects of **ě** depend on what consonant it follows:

- When **ě** follows **d**, **t**, or **n**, the pronunciation changes the consonant to a **d'**, **t'**, or **ň** (resp.) followed by a plain **e**. Compare the sound of "dě" in **"děkuju"** with that of "de" in **"dobrý den"**, and the sound of "tě" in **"Matěj"** with that of "te" in **"Kateřina"**.
- When **ě** follows **m**, the pronunciation effect is as if we replaced the **"mě"** with **"mně"**. In the end, we get something like a **"mñe"** sound.
- When **ě** follows any other consonant, we do not change the pronunciation of the consonant and just pronounce the **ě** like a consonantal "y" (the "y" in "yellow") followed by an **e**.

Finally, this skill also includes examples of **"dí"** and **"tí"** sequences. The rule for those is:

- In domestic Czech words, when followed by an **i** or **í**, **d** is pronounced like **ď**, **t** like **ť**, and **n** like **ň** (whose sounds we know from "**d**ěkuju", "Ma**t**ěj", and "promi**ň**te"). The vowel itself still sounds the same as **y** or **ý**.
