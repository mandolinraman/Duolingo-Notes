# Basics 1

### Welkom!

Welcome to the Dutch course! Dutch is a Germanic language, with grammar and vocabulary similar to other European languages. You might recognize some words from English as well! Even so, Dutch is a language with grammatical genders. These genders have influence on endings on words, for example.

---

### Gender and articles

In Dutch, there are three (grammatical) **genders**: masculine, feminine, and neuter. Each gender has their own definite **article** (‘the’): both singular masculine and feminine nouns use *de* and singular neuter nouns use *het*. For plural nouns, *de* is always used. The definite articles *de* and *het* don't have very clear rules for when you're supposed to use which; this will mostly be learning by heart and developing a feeling for it. However, there are some guidelines to help you along:

***De words***:

1. *De* is always used for plural nouns
2. *De* is always used for professions: *de kok* (‘the chef’), *de leraar* (‘the teacher’)
3. *De* tends to be used for people with an identified gender, such as: *de vader* (‘the father’), *de dochter* (‘the daughter’)
4. *De* is used for vegetables, fruits, trees and plants, names of mountains, and rivers
5. Furthermore, *de* is used for most words ending on **-ie, -ij, -heid, -teit, -schap, -tie, -sie, -aar, -eur, -er**, and **-or**.
6. Finally, *de* is used for written-out numbers and letters: *de drie* (‘the three’), *de a* (‘the a’).

***Het words***:

1. *Het* is always used for diminutives. Diminutives can be recognised by their suffix; they end in **-je, -tje, -etje, -pje**, or **-mpje**.
2. *Het* is always used for words consisting of two syllables and starting with **be-, ge-, ver-**, and **ont-**
3. *Het* is always used for verbs used as nouns. When the infinitive form of a verb is used as a noun (e.g. 'the walking of the dog'), Dutch uses *het* (*het lopen van de hond*).
4. *Het* is always used for languages and names of metals
5. *Het* is also used for names of compass points: *het noorden* (‘the North’)
6. *Het* is used for names of sports and games: *het schaken* (‘chess’), *het voetbal* (‘football/soccer’)
7. Furthermore, *het* is used for words ending on **-isme** and **-ment**

Dutch speakers actually never tend to think about the gender of words. Rather than knowing whether a word is originally feminine or masculine, the only distinction that has to be remembered is the difference between the *de words* and *het words*. This is because it has grammatical consequences (in terms of possessives, question words, demonstratives, adjectives, and even relative pronouns). This is why when you learn a new noun, it is very important to memorize whether it is a *de* or *het word*.

### Pronouns

The Dutch pronouns are as follows:

| English        | Dutch             |
|:-------------- |:----------------- |
| I              | Ik                |
| You (singular) | Jij (Je*)         |
| He/She/It      | Hij/Zij (Ze*)/Het |
| You (formal)   | U                 |
| We             | Wij (We*)         |
| You (plural)   | Jullie            |
| They           | Zij (Ze*)         |

- **Je, ze* and *we* are un-emphasized forms of *jij, zij* and *wij*. The difference will be taught in another skill.

### Verb conjugation

In Dutch, verbs can be recognised by the ending **-en**. For example, *eten* (‘to eat’) and *drinken* (‘to drink’). Verb conjugation in Dutch can get rather difficult, since there are lots of exceptions (welcome to Dutch, where exceptions are the rule!). The most basic rule is: find the stem and add the right ending to it. To find the stem of the word, you take the infinitive of the word – the basic form that you can find in the dictionary – and take off the ending, i.e. **-en**. So in the example of 'drinken', (*to drink*), the stem would be *drink-*. For the simple present, the conjugation is as follows:

| Pronoun     | Conjugation | Example                      |
|:----------- |:----------- |:---------------------------- |
| Ik          | [stem]      | Ik drink (*I drink*)         |
| Jij         | [stem]+t    | Jij drinkt (*You drink*)     |
| Hij/Zij/Het | [stem]+t    | Hij drinkt (*He drinks*)     |
| U           | [stem]+t    | U drinkt (*You drink*)       |
| Wij         | Infinitive  | Wij drinken (*We drink*)     |
| Jullie      | Infinitive  | Jullie drinken (*You drink*) |
| Zij         | Infinitive  | Zij drinken (*They drink*)   |

### Alphabet and pronunciation

The Dutch alphabet has 26 letters – just like in English. In fact, you don’t have to learn any new letters! Hurrah!
However, there are a lot of differences and peculiarities in pronunciation. Some letters are pronounced differently, and there can be combinations of letters that may throw you for a loop. Don’t worry, we are not discussing the letters just now.

### Irregular verbs

In Basics 1 the regular verb conjugations have been explained. Unfortunately, Dutch also has irregular verbs. Fortunately, there are only **6** verbs that are completely irregular. There are more which aren't entirely regular, but you'll meet those in the Past tense.

These are the irregular verbs:

1. Hebben (to have)
2. Kunnen (can)
3. Mogen (may)
4. Willen (to want)
5. Zijn (to be)
6. Zullen (shall)

The most common of these are *Hebben* and *Zijn*, so here are their conjugations in the present tense:

| Hebben            | Zijn           |
|:----------------- |:-------------- |
| Ik heb            | Ik ben         |
| Jij hebt          | Jij bent       |
| U hebt/U heeft    | U bent         |
| Hij/Zij/Het heeft | Hij/Zij/Het is |
| Wij hebben        | Wij zijn       |
| Jullie hebben     | Jullie zijn    |
| Zij hebben        | Zij zijn       |

### Pronunciation

The way Dutch vowels sound depends on whether they are in open or closed syllables. A syllable is closed if it is in a consonant sandwich (e.g. *bed*, ‘bed’) and it is open if it is not (e.g. *ga*, ‘go’).

# Common Phrases 1

### Greetings throughout the day

As in English, Dutch has many different ways of greeting others. The most common one, which you can use all day, is *Hallo*.

An easy way of greeting people throughout the day, is to say the time of day and add ***goede-*** "good" in front of it - just like in English. If the time of day starts with a vowel, you squish an **-n-** in between (an exception being "goede**n**dag"). As follows:

| Time of day      | Greeting    |
|:---------------- |:----------- |
| Morgen (morning) | Goedemorgen |
| Middag (midday)  | Goedemiddag |
| Avond (evening)  | Goedenavond |
| Nacht (night)    | Goedenacht  |
| Dag (day)        | Goedendag   |

### More pronunciation

Besides the letters of the alphabet, Dutch has a lot of combinations of letters that have their own sound. The most common ones are discussed below.

# Negatives 1: Niet & Geen

### Negation

In Dutch, there are two words that are used to negate things: *niet* and *geen*. They are, however, not interchangeable. And since this is Dutch, there are some exceptions to this rule as well.

#### Geen

*Geen* is used to negate **a noun** that, if not negated, would be preceded by *een*. You can say that *geen* translates to ‘not a’. *Geen* is also used if the noun is not preceded by any article, like some plural and uncountable nouns.

| Dutch                                                 | English                                          |
|:----------------------------------------------------- |:------------------------------------------------ |
| Is dat een man? – Nee, dat is **geen** man.           | Is that a man? – No, that is not a man.          |
| Hebben zij boeken? – Nee, zij hebben **geen** boeken. | Do they have books? – No, they don’t have books. |

Note that *geen* can always be translated as the English word "no": That is no man. They have no books. For *niet*, this is almost never the case.

#### Niet

*Niet* is essentially used in all other situations:

1. To negate verbs, thoughts, adjectives, or any other sentence elements that aren’t nouns.
2. To negate nouns preceded by a definite article or possessive pronoun.

| Dutch                      | English                     |
|:-------------------------- |:--------------------------- |
| Ik ren niet.               | I do not run.               |
| Hij is niet zo oud.        | He is not that old.         |
| Zij hebben de boeken niet. | They do not have the books. |

As you can see in the last example, *niet* comes after the object, unlike *geen*. If it is used to negate an adjective or adverb, it comes directly before that word.

# Questions 1: Yes/No

### Questions?

Turning a sentence into a question is relatively easy in Dutch. Unlike in English, where you often have to add the auxiliary verb "to do", you only have to change the word order of the sentence to form a question. For example:

- Hij spreekt Nederlands. - *He speaks Dutch.*
- Spreekt hij Nederlands? - *Does he speak Dutch?*

As you can see, the subject and the verb switch places in a question. This is called **inversion** and you will also encounter it when you learn more complicated sentence structures.

#### Dropping the -t for "je"

When a sentence is inverted, that is, the verb comes before the subject, an odd thing can happen: if the subject is *je* (or the stressed form "jij"), then the verb loses the **-t** at the end.

- Je **spreekt** Nederlands. - *You speak Dutch.*
- **Spreek** je Nederlands? - *Do you speak Dutch?*

This does not happen for any other subject, like *hij* or *ze*! So keep a close eye out for the combination of inversion + *je*.
