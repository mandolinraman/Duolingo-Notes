**Plural adjectives**

In Hungarian adjectives have plural forms .

In English you say *The women are German*, with the word *German* being the same form for both singular and plural. In Hungarian the adjective has to be plural as well:

*A nők német**ek***.

Have a look at the *Tips and Notes* section of the skill **Plurals 1** to refresh your memory about how to form plurals of nouns.

Adjectives are a bit different. The plural suffix will be *-ak* when an adjective consists of mixed back vowels and *neutral* vowels like *e, i*. Look at the following words:

*amerikai* + *-k* = *amerikai**ak*** ‘Americans’

*kanadai* + *-k* = *kanadai**ak*** ‘Canadians’

*egyiptomi* + *-k* = *egyiptomi**ak*** ‘Egyptians’

If an adjective ends in a consonant, you can rely on what you learned in **Plurals 1**:

*brazil* + *-k* = *brazil**ok*** ‘Brazilians’

*japán* + *-k* = *japán**ok*** ‘Japanese’ (plural)

In Hungarian you don't have to capitalize words referring to nationalities, but in English you do.

When talking about Brazil, be careful :

*brazil* = Brazilian (nationality of a person)

*Brazília* = Brazil (the country)

***van* in Hungarian**

Remember that the third person forms of *to be* do not always appear. When we talk about the subject and use adjectives, there is *no* verb in the Hungarian sentence.

In

*A nők németek.*

there is no verb. You can't omit it in English, of course!

**Generic statements**

You will come across *general* statements. Those are sentences that express something that is **true in general**, for example the following:

*Dogs have four legs.*

This means that *In general, dogs have four legs.* There is an important difference between such statements in English and Hungarian. In English you don't have to use an article for the subject in those sentences, in Hungarian you usually do. Compare the following:

*Dutch people are tall.* *A hollandok magasak.*

In Hungarian, you can't say *Hollandok magasak* to mean *Dutch people are tall*, you have to add the definite article *a(z)*.

# Adjectives 1

In this skill you will learn a bunch of new adjectives. We tried to vary the sentence structures to make you practice them. There will be:

- This is a [adjective] [noun]. = Ez egy [adjective] [noun].
- This is a black car. = Ez egy fekete autó.
- This [noun] is [adjective]. Ez a(z) [noun] [adjective].
- This car is black. Ez az autó fekete.

#### What is the difference between idős, öreg and régi?

Use idős and öreg for people, and régi for objects.

Ez egy régi ház. This is an old house.

A nagymamám öreg. My grandmother is old.

A nagymamám idős. My grandmother is elderly.

Idős is more like elderly, it is more polite to say, while saying öreg is less polite - in some situations.

“Régi” has a special meaning when used for people :

egy régi barátom = an old friend of mine . We have been friends for a long time. The friend is not necessarily old .

egy öreg / idős barátom = an old friend of mine (the friend is actually old)

#### What is the difference between kicsi and kis?

Immediately before a noun (or before another adjective that refers to the same noun) we can use either kis or kicsi.

egy kicsi ház = egy kis ház = a small house

egy kis piros labda = egy kicsi piros labda = a small red ball

And, kis- can be used to form compound words: kislány (little girl) kismacska (little cat).

But, AFTER the noun, only kicsi works ! You’re making a statement , you're forming a sentence.

A ház kicsi. = The house is small.

Ez a kék autó kicsi. = This blue car is small.

Az a piros labda kicsi. = That red ball is small.

But * *A ház kis.* would be wrong.

# Verbs 2 Present Plural

**plural verbs in the present**

"We, you and they " and, **vowel harmony**.

- *Csinálni* means ‘to make’ or ‘to do’. It has a *back* vowel (á). Its forms are :

|     | *csinálni* ‘to make/do’      | suffix (ending)    |
|:--- |:---------------------------- |:------------------ |
| 1SG | *csinál-**ok*** ‘I make’     | *-ok*              |
| 2SG | *csinál-**sz*** ‘you make’   | *-sz*              |
| 3SG | *csinál* ‘s/he makes’        | (null - no ending) |
| 1PL | *csinál-**unk*** ‘we make’   | *-unk*             |
| 2PL | *csinál-**tok*** ‘you make’  | *-tok*             |
| 3PL | *csinál-**nak*** ‘they make’ | *-nak*             |

We also have front vowel verbs.

|      | *pihenni* ‘to rest’        | suffix (ending) |
| :--- | :------------------------- | :-------------- |
| 1SG  | *pihen-**ek*** ‘I rest’    | *-ek*           |
| 2SG  | *pihen-**sz*** ‘you rest’  | *-sz*           |
| 3SG  | *pihen* ‘s/he rests’       | (null)          |
| 1PL  | *pihen-**ünk*** ‘we rest’  | *-ünk*          |
| 2PL  | *pihen-**tek*** ‘you rest’ | *-tek*          |
| 3PL  | *pihen-**nek*** they rest’ | *-nek*          |

This table summarizes the suffixes based on vowel harmony:

|     | front suffixes | back suffixes |
|:--- |:-------------- |:------------- |
| 1SG | *-ök* /*-ek*   | *-ok*         |
| 2SG | *-sz*          | *-sz*         |
| 3SG | (null)         | (null)        |
| 1PL | *-ünk*         | *-unk*        |
| 2PL | *-tek* /*-tök* | *-tok*        |
| 3PL | *-nek*         | *-nak*        |

But ***-ik*-verbs** !

Here's another kind of verb: the *-ik*-verb! Its name comes from the third person singular ending , *-ik*, instead of (null ) no-ending like regular verbs.

- *játsz-ik* ‘s/he plays’, ‘s/he is playing’
- *esz-ik* ‘s/he eats’, ‘s/he is eating’

Another difference between an -ik verb and a regular verb is that the *first* person singular can (but doesn't have to ) end in *-m* -even without a definite object.

- *játsz-om* ‘I play‘, ‘I am playing’
- *esz-em* ‘I eat’, ‘I am eating’

In many grammar books, you might only find the *-m* ending , but today, many speakers alternate between using *-m* or the usual *-k* . Duo accepts either !

Some other *-ik*-verbs are: *dolgozik* ‘works’, *eszik* ‘eats’, *iszik* 'drinks’, *játszik* 'plays’, *úszik* ‘swims’.

There's no way to tell if a verb is an -ik verb except memorization.

**Subjects**

Hungarian is a *null subject language*, you don't always need a subject . Examples :

*They are going home.* *Hazamennek.*

Both mean the same, but in the Hungarian there is no *they* - you have to figure it out from the verb's ending .

Hungarian has more pronouns than English :

|         | Singular | Plural |
|:------- |:-------- |:------ |
| **1st** | én       | mi     |
| **2nd** | te       | ti     |
| **3rd** | ő        | ők     |

Note that *you* can be singular or plural, *te* is second person singular, *ti* second person plural. When you see a sentence like : *Are you going home?* , it can be translated into Hungarian as either the singular or the plural.

Hungarian has a few MORE pronouns for "YOU " They are used to address someone formally - like French *vous*, Spanish *usted* and German *Sie* - and many other languages, too .

These pronouns are *ön* (singular) and *önök* (plural), AND *maga* (singular) and *maguk* (plural). One thing to keep in mind when using these pronouns is that they behave like third person pronouns (like Spanish *usted*/*ustedes*) . So when using *ön*, the verb will look like it has a third person subject !

*Ön eszik.* You are eating (formal, singular)

*Ő eszik* He/She is eating.

*Te eszel.* You are eating (informal, singular)

# Definite Conjugation

The **definite conjugation** is a bit of Hungarian that we don't have in English !

In sentences with an "accusative " (a direct object), the conjugation depends on whether that object is "definite " or not. The forms we have learned so far are in the **indefinite conjugation**.

When a direct object is definite, the verb must be in the **definite** conjugation !

(i) Lát-***ok*** egy kutyá-***t***.

(ii) Lát-***om*** a kutyá-***t***.

In (i), the object is **indefinite**, ’a dog’. In (ii), it is **definite**, ’THE dog’. In (ii), the verb changes to *lát**om***. The ending *-om* is in the definite conjugation.

(iii) Látom .

(iii) means ‘I see IT .’ The definite conjugation is only used with a definite direct object, so there is an object - even if you don't see it !

Plus, vowel harmony!

Here are the definite verb forms of *hallani* ‘to hear’, *szeretni* ‘to like/love’ and *keresni* ‘to be looking for’.

|     | SG                       | PL                             |
|:--- |:------------------------ |:------------------------------ |
| 1   | *hallom* ‘I hear it’     | *halljuk* ‘we hear it’         |
| 2   | *hallod* ‘you hear it’   | *halljátok* ‘you (pl) hear it’ |
| 3   | *hallja* ‘s/he hears it’ | *hallják* ‘they hear it’       |

|     | SG                        | PL                              |
|:--- |:------------------------- |:------------------------------- |
| 1   | *szeretem* ‘I love it’    | *szeretjük* ‘we love it’        |
| 2   | *szereted* ‘you love it’  | *szeretitek* ‘you (pl) love it’ |
| 3   | *szereti* ‘s/he loves it’ | *szeretik* ‘they love it’       |

|     | SG                                 | PL                                        |
|:--- |:---------------------------------- |:----------------------------------------- |
| 1   | *keresem* ‘I am looking for it’    | *keressük* ‘we are looking for it’        |
| 2   | *keresed* ‘you are looking for it’ | *keresitek* ‘you (pl) are looking for it’ |
| 3   | *keresi* ‘s/he is looking for it’  | *keresik* ‘they are looking for it’       |

Important ! the *-j-* does not always appear in the definite conjugation. And, when the j follows *-s*, *-z*, *-sz*, or *-zs*, the consonant is doubled and loses the *-j-* (ss, zz, ssz, zzs ) :

- *keres* + ***jük*** = *kere**ssük*** ‘we look for it’
- *hoz* + ***ja*** = *ho**zza*** ‘s/he brings it’
- *(meg)vesz* + ***jük*** = *(meg)ve**sszük*** ‘we buy/take it’

**Verb prefixes**

Another thing to keep in mind for this lesson is that many Hungarian verbs come with a *verbal particle*, as :

***meg-\látogatja* ‘s/he visits’ (with a definite object!)

This particle/prefix attaches to the front of the verb, but in questions - or when the sentence is stressing information about a subject or an object - it is detached and follows the verb .

(v) *Ki **látogatja meg** Pétert?* ‘Who visits Péter?’

(vi) *Péter **látogatja meg** Zsuzsát.* ‘PETER is visiting Zsuzsa.‘

The Hungarian word order in (vi) stresses PETER: you are stressing that the sentence is about Peter, not about someone, or something else.

# Date and Time

In this unit, you'll learn how to express date and time. You'll learn a few past tense expressions (more on that later), the days of the week, and months.

In the past tense you can mostly use the same verb endings as before, but... in the verb endings, a *-t-* indicates that it is in the past tense:

|     | *csinál* ‘to make/do’                |
|:--- |:------------------------------------ |
| 1SG | *csinál-**t**-am* ‘I made’           |
| 2SG | *csinál-**t**-ál* ‘you (sg.) made’   |
| 3SG | *csinál-**t*** ‘he made’             |
| 1PL | *csinál-**t**-unk* ‘we made’         |
| 2PL | *csinál-**t**-atok* ‘you (pl.) made’ |
| 3PL | *csinál-**t**-ak* ‘they made’        |

You'll learn more about the past tense later !

As in many languages, you can use the present tense to talk about things in the future. It is fine to say.

- *Holnap megyek.* (literally ’tomorrow I go’)

to mean ‘I will go tomorrow.’

#### The days of the week

The word *nap* means both ‘day’ and ‘sun’ in Hungarian. But it only shows up in one of the week's days :

- *hétfő* ‘Monday’
- *kedd* ‘Tuesday’
- *szerda* ‘Wednesday’
- *csütörtök* ‘Thursday’
- *péntek* ‘Friday’
- *szombat* ‘Saturday’
- *vasárnap* ‘Sunday’

If you speak a Slavic language, some of these might sound familiar to you! To express that something happens *on* a certain day, Hungarian uses a case-suffix which is also used for some of the seasons :

- *hétfő-**n*** ‘on Monday’
- *kedd-**en*** ‘on Tuesday’
- *szerdá-**n*** ‘on Wednesday’
- *csütörtök-**ön*** ‘on Thursday’
- *péntek-**en*** ‘on Friday’
- *szombat-**on*** ‘on Saturday’
- *vasárnap* ‘on Sunday’

As in the plural, the vowel in the suffix depends on the vowels in the stem, so we get *-on*,*-en*, or *-ön* .

Note that there is an exception: *vasárnap* - 'Sunday' and ‘on Sunday’ For Sunday, we don't use any ending.

#### The months

In Hungarian, the names of the months are similar to the names of the months in many other European languages, including English.

- *január* ‘January’
- *február* ‘February’
- *március* ‘March’
- *április* ‘April’
- *május* ‘May’
- *június* ‘June’
- *július* ‘July’
- *augusztus* ‘August’
- *szeptember* ‘September’
- *október* ‘October’
- *november* ‘November’
- *december* ‘December’

To say that something happened *in* a certain month, Hungarian uses the case suffix *-ban* or *-ben*:

- *január-**ban*** ‘in January’
- *szeptember-**ben*** ‘in September’

#### The seasons

While English uses *in* or *during* to express that something is happening in a season, Hungarian is a bit different. The seasons, first of all are the following:

- *tavasz* ‘spring’
- *nyár* ’summer’
- *ősz* ‘autumn’
- *tél* ‘winter’

But, there are two different case-suffixes to mark what's happening during a season:

- *tava-**sszal*** ’in spring’
- *nyár-**on*** ‘in summer’
- *ős-**szel*** ‘in autumn’
- *tél-**en*** ‘in winter’

A tiny tip: none of these endings have a diacritic (accent mark)

#### Back to past tense

There are 5 different past tense verbs in this skill,

"volt" "született" "csinált" "találkozott" "beszélt"

We discussed "csinált", now here are the **past tense indefinite** conjugations for the other four:

|     | *van*    |

| 3SG | volt     |
| 1PL | voltunk  |

|:--- |:----------- |
| 1SG | születtem   |
| 2SG | születtél   |
| 3SG | született   |
| 1PL | születtünk  |
| 2PL | születtetek |
