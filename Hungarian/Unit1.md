# Basic Phrases

#### Welcome to the Hungarian course!

Here you'll meet your first Hungarian phrases as well as a few verbs, most importantly, *lenni* ‘to be’. It is conjugated as follows:

|     | SG                          | PL                            |
|:--- |:--------------------------- |:----------------------------- |
| 1   | *(én) vagyok* ‘I am’        | *(mi) vagyunk* ‘we are’       |
| 2   | *(te) vagy* ‘you (sg.) are’ | *(ti) vagytok* ‘you (pl) are’ |
| 3   | *(ő) van* ‘s/he is’         | *(ők) vannak* ‘they are’      |

The pronouns in the Hungarian examples are in parentheses because you mostly don't have to use them. The verb form tells you which person and number is indicated.

#### Orthography (spelling ) and pronunciation

Hungarian uses the Latin alphabet (like English) with some additional letters and diacritics. Let's start with the vowels.

Vowels can be **short** and **long**. Short vowels are *a*, *e*, *i*, *o*, *u*, *ö* and *ü*. Their long versions are *á*, *é*, *í*, *ó*, *ú*, *ő* and *ű*.

Consonants can ALSO be **short** and **long**. Long consonants are "lengthened " by doubling them, as in *reggel* ’morning’ .

Some Hungarian consonants are spelled very differently from their English counterparts:

| Letter | Hungarian pronunciation    |
|:------ |:-------------------------- |
| *c*    | like *ts* in *ca**ts***    |
| *cs*   | like *ch* in ***ch\annel*  |
| *s*    | like *sh* in ***sh\ower*   |
| *sz*   | like *s* in ***s\ing*      |
| *zs*   | like *s* in *plea**s**ure* |

So Hungarian *szia* (’hello’ or ’goodbye’) sounds a bit like English *see ya*.

The letters *gy*, *ny*, *ty* represent sounds that sound a bit like adding a *y* sound to the preceding sound.

Take a look at this video (there are others) to hear how the vowels and consonants are pronounced:

# Basic 1

**Lesson 1**

Just like in English, Hungarian has definite articles and an indefinite article.

*A* and *az* are like English's *the* . *A fiú* = *the boy* .

If the word starts with a vowel, you use *az*. For a consonant, you use *a*.

*az alma*, *a fiú*

Hungarian's indefinite article is simpler: the indefinite article *a or an* is always *egy*.

*egy alma*, *egy fiú*

Don't confuse Hungarian's *a* / *az*, the definite article meaning *the*, with English's *a* / *an*, which are the indefinite articles, meaning *egy*!

**Lenni, the verb "to be"**

The present tense is :

|     | SG                          | PL                              |
|:--- |:--------------------------- |:------------------------------- |
| 1   | *(én) vagyok* ‘I am’        | *(mi) vagyunk* ‘we are’         |
| 2   | *(te) vagy* ‘you (sg.) are’ | *(ti) vagytok* ‘you (pl. ) are’ |
| 3   | *(ő) van* ‘s/he is’         | *(ők) vannak* ‘they are’        |

The subject pronouns are in parentheses because they are often dropped , the verb conjugation shows the person.

You are a teacher can be *Te tanár vagy*. or just *Tanár vagy.*

#### When to include van/vannak

Hungarian sometimes drops van and vannak. Sometimes there's NO verb where English has *is* ! You would say *What is this ?*, Hungarian drops the "is " :

*Mi ez?* = what is this ? . . .

Hungarian word order is freer than in English. To ask *What is this?*, both *Mi ez?* and *Ez mi?* are fine.

Be alert! The verb is only left out when the subject is in the third person AND the sentence expresses a property of the subject like *Ez \*mi\*?* “What is this?“, *Péter egy \*diák** “Péter is a student.”, or *Péter \*álmos** “Péter is tired.”

**This only happens in the third person**, the first and second person (I, you, we, plural you ) *vagyok, vagy, vagyunk, vagytok* are NEVER omitted.

**Don't** use van or vannak if you are saying **what** someone or something is.

"Ő tanár" - "He is a teacher"

"Péter tanár" - "Péter is a teacher"

"Az alma piros" - "The apple is red"

"Mi az?" - "What's that?"

But, **do** use van/vannak when describing *when, how, the state, or where* something or someone is.

**Time** - Expressing when something is.

"Mikor van a buli?" - "When is the party?" "A buli hétkor van." - "The party is at 7."

**State** - how something/someone is.

"Apád ma hogy van?" = "How is your dad today?" "Ma jobban van, mint tegnap, köszönöm." - "He is better today than he was yesterday, thank you."

**Location**

"Hol van a mozi?" - "Where is the cinema?" "Ott van jobbra." - "It's there on the right."

**Adverbial Participle** - a verbal state of a noun

"Ki van nyitva az ablak?" - "Is the window open?" "Nem, be van zárva." - "No, it's shut."

All the above become "vannak" when the subject is plural:

"Itt vannak a poharak." - "Here are the glasses."

"A szobák fűtve vannak." - "The rooms are heated."

# First Names

*Péter*, *Kati* and *Éva* are common Hungarian names.

There are several ways of asking someone what their name is, here are two .

- One is *a neved*, meaning ‘your name’ . You can ask someone *Mi a neved* or ‘What is your name?’ — Recall that we don't always say *is* in Hungarian.
- Another is to use *hogy hívnak*, which is literally ‘How do they call you?’, but it's just another way to say ‘What's your name?’.

# Basic 2

**The verb \*lenni\* ‘to be’**

|     | SG                          | PL                            |
|:--- |:--------------------------- |:----------------------------- |
| 1   | *(én) vagyok* ‘I am’        | *(mi) vagyunk* ‘we are’       |
| 2   | *(te) vagy* ‘you (sg.) are’ | *(ti) vagytok* ‘you (pl) are’ |
| 3   | *(ő) van* ‘s/he is’         | *(ők) vannak* ‘they are’      |

The most important thing to keep in mind is when to use the third person *van* ‘is’ and *vannak* ‘are’, and when to leave them out!

These examples will help illustrate the difference.

*Én tanár vagyok.* meaning ‘I am a teacher.’

*Ő tanár.* meaning ‘She/he is a teacher.’

In the first sentence above, there is a verb, *vagyok*, but in the second sentence there is no *van*.

When expressing **what something is like**, you do not use *van* .

The following examples are fine without *van* or *vannak*, in fact, you must not use *van* here :

*Az autó piros.* ‘The car is red.’

*A fiúk tanárok.* ‘The boys are teachers.’

**Personal pronouns**

|     | SG               | PL               |
|:--- |:---------------- |:---------------- |
| 1   | *én* ’I’         | *mi* ’we’        |
| 2   | *te* ’you (sg.)’ | *ti* ’you (pl.)’ |
| 3   | *ő* ’she/he/it’  | *ők* ’they’      |

But there are many differences between the two languages:

- Hungarian has pronouns for the second person singular AND the second person plural: *te* means ‘you (sg.)’, while *ti* means ‘you (pl.)’.
- Hungarian has **no gender**: the third person singular pronoun *ő* means both ‘she’ and ‘he’. Thus a sentence like *Ő tanár* can mean either ‘She is a teacher’ or ‘He is a teacher’.
- Like German, French and Spanish, Hungarian has pronouns that are used when talking formally to someone : *ön* in the singular and *önök* in the plural. They're translated as ‘you’ and they are used in formal settings when talking to someone senior, or a stranger, and when being polite.

# Occupations

#### Gender in occupations

Hungarian does not usually specify one's gender: the pronoun *ő* means ‘he’ and ‘she’. But, when speaking about jobs and occupations, there is a way of showing genders .

For most occupations, like *művész* ‘artist’ or *rendőr* ‘policeman’, just add *nő* ‘woman’ .

*művésznő* is a female artist, and *rendőrnő* is a policewoman.

#### Nem... hanem... sentences

Én nem a szakács vagyok, hanem a pincér. I am not the cook, but rather the waiter.

These nem/hanem types of sentences consist of two parts, and mean something like **It is not X, but Y** where X and Y contrast. X and Y can be two nouns, two places, two adjectives, two verbs, etc.

Both *de* and *hanem* translate to *but*, but they are not the same. Think of *hanem* as *but rather*. If you speak German, de=aber, hanem=sondern.

When to use *hanem*, and when to use *de* ?.

*Hanem* is never alone, if *hanem* is used, there will always be *nem* in the first part of the sentence.

**Nem**

*Nem* precedes what it negates. To find the place for nem, look into the second part of the sentence . The negation has to contrast with the hanem part.

Én nem a szakács vagyok, hanem a pincér. I am not the cook, but the waiter. The contrast is : the waiter versus the cook, so nem comes before a szakács.

Nem én vagyok a pincér, hanem ő. It is not ME who is the waiter, but HIM . The contrast is : me versus him, so nem is placed before én.

The verb can be in the middle of the sentence (after nem X) or at the end (after hanem Y). A megálló nem itt van, hanem ott. A megálló nem itt, hanem ott van. (The stop is not here, but there.)

Occasionally the contrasting pair is two verbs: Én nem állok, hanem ülök. I am not standing, but sitting.

# Places 1

#### Postpositions

We'll start with locations and relations between locations .

English has **pre**positions, words like *on*, *in*, *by*, etc. which express location:

- *on the building*, *in the city*, *by the tree*

Hungarian expresses some of these meanings using suffixes , and some of them using **post**positions, not prepositions .

We'll learn some words for buildings and some *postpositions*.

In English, we say ***behind\*** *the house* . In Hungarian, we say *a ház* ***mögött\***.

*Egy* ***ház mögött\*** *állok.* — ‘I am standing behind a house.’

*Van egy kert a* ***ház mögött.\*** — ‘There is a garden behind the house.’

*A tó a nagy* ***ház mögött\*** *van.* — ‘The lake is behind the big house.’

The order in which words can follow each other is often fixed:

- 1. adjective 2. noun: *nagy ház*
- 1. noun 2. postposition: *ház mögött*
- 1. adjective 2. noun 3. postposition: *a nagy ház mögött*

Meet six postpositions:

- *előtt* — ‘in front of’
- *mögött* — ‘behind’
- *alatt* — ‘under’
- *fölött* — ‘above’
- *mellett* — ‘next to’
- *között* — ‘between’

We will use the suffixes *-ban* / *-ben* . These are used for the English preposition "in":

- *a táskában* — ‘in the bag’
- *a könyvben* — ‘in the book’
- *az épületben* — ‘in the building’

In English we make a difference between "in" and "at", in Hungarian, we only use *-ban* / *-ben*:

- *Iskolában vagy?* — ‘Are you at (in ) school?’
- *Az iskolában fehér az ablak.* — ‘The windows are white in (at ) the school.’

Suffixes are always attached to the noun they refer to, as if they were “glued together”. Postpositions are always "loose " .

#### nincs

In Hungarian, *nem van* (side-by-side ) can only be said or written *nincs*. Compare:

| person  | localising             | feeling bad         |
|:------- |:---------------------- |:------------------- |
| én      | **Nem vagyok** otthon. | **Nem vagyok** jól. |
| te      | **Nem vagy** otthon?   | **Nem vagy** jól?   |
| Ön/Maga | **Nincs** otthon?      | **Nincs** jól?      |
| ő       | **Nincs** otthon.      | **Nincs** jól.      |

#### Word order in questions

Questions have stricter rules than statements. In Hungarian, if the question has a question word (who, what, where, when, why, how), then that word must be placed immediately in front of the verb.

It's good to start a question with a question word, but not always necessary.

Examples:

- *Mi van* a város fölött?
- A város fölött *mi van?*
- *Ki sétál* a régi házak között?
- A régi házak között *ki sétál?*

The question word must come immediately before the verb. It is always in focus - since focus is on the word or phrase immediately before the verb.

*Exceptions:*

When a question word is a part of a "block", like How many cars? How much water? - Then put this "block" before the verb.

*Hány autót lát* Péter? - How many cars does Péter see?

*Mennyi víz van* a pohárban? - How much water is in the glass?

Also, *miért* (why) does not have to be right before the verb.

Miért dolgozol? - Why are you working?

Miért *te* dolgozol? - Why is it *you* who is working?

# Verbs 1 : Present Single

Here are the present tense singular (I, you, s/he ) forms .

- *Tanulni* means both ‘to learn’ and ‘to study’. Its stem is *tanul-* . Its 'indefinite ' present conjugation is :

|     | *tanulni* ‘to learn/study’ | suffix (ending) |
|:--- |:-------------------------- |:--------------- |
| 1   | *tanul-**ok*** ‘I learn’   | *-ok*           |
| 2   | *tanul-**sz*** ‘you learn’ | *-sz*           |
| 3   | *tanul* ‘she/he learns’    | (null)          |

These suffixes (endings ) are used for all the verbs in Lesson 1.

In Lesson 2, we find verbs like *sietni* ‘to hurry’. This table shows the singular forms of *sietni*.

|     | *sietni* ‘to hurry’       | suffix (ending) |
|:--- |:------------------------- |:--------------- |
| 1   | *siet-**ek*** ‘I hurry’   | *-ek*           |
| 2   | *siet-**sz*** ‘you hurry’ | *-sz*           |
| 3   | *siet* ‘she/he hurries’   | (null)          |

Notice that the first person singular suffix for *sietni* is *-ek*, not *-ok* as in 'tanulni ' ? Why?

What's happening here is **vowel harmony**, which you will need for more than to conjugate verbs...

**Vowel harmony** means that the vowels (*a*, *e*, *i*, *o* and *u* ) in a word require that the vowels in suffixes (like *-ek* and *-ok*) "match " the vowels in the words they attach to:

We use * *-ok* when the verb it attaches to contains the vowels *a*, *á*, *o*, *ó*, *u*, or *ú*.

- *-ek* occurs when the verb it attaches to contains *i*, *í*, *e*, *é*.

and * *-ök* occurs when the verb it attaches to contains *ö*, *ő*, *ü*, or *ű*.

The vowels in the suffixes have to be in “harmony” with the vowels in the word they attach to. Moreover, this “harmony” has two groups of vowels, called “back” and “front” (and later "rounded " :

| *front* vowels     | *back* vowels |
|:------------------ |:------------- |
| *i*, *í*, *ü*, *ű* | *u*, *ú*      |
| *e*, *é*, *ö*, *ő* | *o*, *ó*      |
|                    | *a*, *á*      |

This table helps determine which vowel should precede the *-k* in the first person singular — If they are back, we get *-ok*. If they are front, we get *-ek* or *-ök*.

There are exceptions; you'll learn about those a little later!

#### About word order

Word order in Hungarian is more flexible than in English, but it is not completely free (more about this soon).

Some words, or parts of the sentence , have to come immediately before the verb - a location called "focus " .

Question words like *ki* ‘who’ or *mi* ‘what’ ...

- *Ki sétál a piac mellett?* ‘Who is taking a walk next to the marketplace ? ‘

Or when you compare or contrast two phrases (or words), one is in focus and has to come right before the verb.

For example:

- *Nem a piac mellett sétálok, hanem az áruház mellett.* ‘I am not walking next to the market, but next to the department store.‘

The contrast is between *a piac mellett* ‘next to the market‘ and *az áruház mellett* ‘next to the department store‘.

# Accusative

#### Direct Objects and the accusative case

The accusative is a fancy word for DIRECT OBJECT ! In Hungarian, it is shown by a * t * - on a direct object !

*Fiú*, ’boy’ , becomes *fiút* when it is the DIRECT OBJECT !

In English, direct objects usually follow the subject and the predicate, as in

- The girl sees a **boy**.

*Boy* is the direct object, *girl* is the subject, and *sees* is the predicate.

In Hungarian, the word order can be less regular, but the direct object case is marked with *t* :

- A lány lát egy **fiút**.

The subject is *lány* , the verb is *lát*, and ***fiút\*** is the direct object, with its accusative ending, *t* ! So, that "t " is a helpful hint to Hungarians that this word is a DIRECT OBJECT .

#### Accusative endings

If a word ends in *i*, *í*, *o*, *ó*, *ö*, *ő*, *u*, *ú*, *ü*, or *ű* (not *a* or *e*), then *t* is added directly to the end of the word

- *fiú* -> *fiút*
- *nő* -> *nőt*

But words ending in *-a* and *-e*, become *-á* and *-é* when they get the *t*.

- *alma* ’apple’ -> almá**t**
- *körte* ’pear’ -> körté**t**

If the word ends in a consonant, we USUALLY have to add a vowel before the accusative *t* **-ot / -at / -et / -öt** . Which vowel is determined by vowel harmony ! Words with front vowels get a front vowel before the *t*, words with back vowels get a back vowel. But -r / -l / -n / - ny / - s / -sz / -z / -j / -ly take the **-t** directly (see below ) .

| *back* vowels | *front* vowels |
|:------------- |:-------------- |
| *a*, *á*      | *e*, *é*,      |
| *o*, *ó*      | *i*, *í*,      |
| *u*, *ú*      | *ö*, *ő*       |
|               | *ü*, *ű*       |

-back vowels usually get **-ot**

- *sajt* ‘cheese’ -> sajt**ot**
- *narancs* 'orange' -> narancs**ot**

-some words, which you have to memorize, get **-at**:

- *ház* ‘house’ -> ház**at**
- *toll* 'pen' -> toll**at**

-front vowels get **-et**:

- *szék* ’chair’ -> szék**et**
- *zöldség* ’vegetable’ -> zöldség**et**
- round vowel words which have ö / ő / ü / ü in the last syllable get **-öt**
- *gyümölcs* ’fruit’ -> gyümölcs**öt**
- *főnök* ’boss’ -> főnök**öt**

When the word ends in -r / -l / -n / - ny / - s / -sz / -z / -j / -ly we USUALLY add the **-t** directly .

- *bor* ’wine’ -> bor**t**
- *lány* ’girl’ -> lány**t**

#### A note on word order

In sentences with a subject, verb and object, Hungarian has very **flexible word order**. All of the following can be used in certain contexts:

- *Péter lát egy házat.*
- *Péter egy házat lát.*
- *Egy házat lát Péter.*
- *Egy házat Péter lát.*

They all mean ‘Péter sees a house.’, but each sentence conveys slightly different information with respect to which element is in FOCUS (or stressed ) . A **focused phrase** appears immediately in front of the verb and it often represents **new information** or **contrast**.

The first sentence (with Péter above ), for example, would be a valid answer to a question like ‘Who sees a house?’ but the second sentence would be " A HOUSE is what Peter sees ", because here *egy házat* ‘a house’ immediately precedes the verb and is, therefore, in focus.

FOCUS can be very tricky, but English has similar constructions !

If you have

- *What does Péter see?*

the question word is in focus and asks for new information. In the reply, the answer to *what* will also be new information and be in focus.

And in English you can say,

- *Péter sees* ***a house\***.

or

- ***It's a house\*** *that Péter sees.*

Or:

- *It is Péter who sees a house.*

Each of these stresses something different. In Hungarian, it's done with FOCUS . . .

**Word order in questions**

Question words generally ask for some (new) information and act like a focused part of the sentence. In Hungarian, a question like ‘Who(m) does Mari see?’ ’who(m)’ is in focus and has to appear right before the verb:

- *Kit lát Mari?*
- *Mari kit lát?*

#### Keresni

If the root (stem ) of a verb ends with s, z, sz, then the second person singular informal (te) form ends with l.

|     | keres (search) | olvas (read) | vesz (buy) |     |
|:--- |:-------------- |:------------ |:---------- |:--- |
| én  | keresek        | olvasok      | veszek     |     |
| te  | keresel        | olvasol      | veszel     |     |
| ő   | keres          | olvas        | vesz       |     |

# Plurals and Accusative 1

#### Plurals

You just learned how to spot, form and use the **accusative case**. , but so far only in the singular.

Remember the plural of Hungarian nouns is formed with the *-k*, often preceded by a vowel.

Let's take the demonstrative determiners (demonstrative adjectives ) *ez* ‘this’ and *az* ’that’ first.

- *ez* ’this’ -> *ez**ek*** ’these’
- *az* ’that’ -> *az**ok*** ’those’

Which vowel ? Remember **vowel harmony** ? *Ez* has a front vowel, and *az* has a back vowel.

| *front* vowels     | *back* vowels |
|:------------------ |:------------- |
| *i*, *í*, *ü*, *ű* | *u*, *ú*      |
| *e*, *é*, *ö*, *ő* | *o*, *ó*      |
|                    | *a*, *á*      |

Thus the vowel before the plural ending *-k* will be front or back. So we get *ezek* and *azok*.

Tricky ! When a word ends in a vowel, like *a* or *e*, for example *alma* ‘apple’, the vowel lengthens :

- *alma* ‘apple’ -> *almák* ‘apples’

#### Plural and accusative

When words are both plural and in the accusative, we have to arrange the plural *-k* and the accusative *-t* . Note that if both are there, we will need a vowel between the *-k* and the *-t*!

- *alma* + *-k* (plural) + *-t* (accusative) -> *almá*+***k\***+***at\*** = *almákat* ‘apples (obj.)'

If we want to use *these* or *those* as objects, we get:

- *ez* ‘this’ -> *ezek* ‘these’ -> *ezeket* ’these (obj.)’
- *az* ‘that’ -> *azok* ‘those’ -> *azokat* ‘those (obj.)’

#### Sneak preview: definite conjugation

You'll learn the *definite conjugation* soon, but here's a little primer.

Tricky ! When an object in the accusative is **definite**, the form of the verb changes slightly.

Important: **Definite** phrases have a definite article *a* or *az* ‘the’ , or demonstratives like *ez* ‘this‘ or *az* ‘that‘, or there will be someone's name(s) .

So when you see apples, you say:

*Látok almákat* ‘I see apples’ *Látsz almákat* ‘you (sg.) see apples’

*Almákat* is indefinite. *Látok * is in the indefinite .

When you want to say *I see those*, which is now definite (because of the demonstrative adjective 'azok ' , you say:

*Látom azokat* ‘I see those’ or *Látod azokat* ‘you (sg.) see those’

You can also use *látom*, without an object, to say ‘I see **it** ’. In this lesson, you'll see a few examples of the definite conjugation .

|     | SG                     |
|:--- |:---------------------- |
| 1   | *hallom* ‘I hear it’   |
| 2   | *hallod* ‘you hear it’ |

|     | SG                                 |
|:--- |:---------------------------------- |
| 1   | *keresem* ‘I am looking for it’    |
| 2   | *keresed* ‘you are looking for it’ |

# Plurals and Accusative 2

#### Plural

We've learned how to form and use the direct object **accusative** -t . But, so far, all our examples have been singular.

The plural is formed by adding *-k*, sometimes , though, it needs a vowel.

Let's take the demonstrative adjectives *ez* ‘this’ and *az* ’that’ first.

- *ez* ’this’ -> *ez**ek*** ’these’
- *az* ’that’ -> *az**ok*** ’those’

Which vowel ? **Vowel harmony** will tell you ! *Ez* has a front vowel, and *az* has a back vowel.

| *front* vowels     | *back* vowels |
|:------------------ |:------------- |
| *i*, *í*, *ü*, *ű* | *u*, *ú*      |
| *e*, *é*, *ö*, *ő* | *o*, *ó*      |
|                    | *a*, *á*      |

So, the vowel before the plural ending *-k* will also be front or back. So we get *ezek* and *azok*.

If a word ends in *a* (or *e*), like *alma* ‘apple’, the "a ", before the plural ending, lengthens - :

- *alma* ‘apple’ -> *almák* ‘apples’

#### in the Plural AND in the accusative (direct object )

When words are plural AND accusative, we have to arrange the plural's *-k* and the accusative's *-t* . If both are there, we need a vowel between the *-k* and the *-t* !

- *alma* + *-k* (plural) + *-t* (accusative) -> *almá*+***k\***+***at\*** = *almákat* ‘apples (obj.)'

If we want *these* and *those* as direct objects, we get:

- *ez* ‘this’ -> *ezek* ‘these’ -> *ezeket* ’these (d. obj.)’
- *az* ‘that’ -> *azok* ‘those’ -> *azokat* ‘those (d. obj.)’

#### Contrast and word order

Hungarian word order is less free in sentences that express a contrast.

*The judge is looking for lawyers and finds actors.*

Here, there is one *subject*, namely *judge*.

But there are two different verbs, *is looking for* and *finds* and each of these have their own object, *lawyers* and *actors*.

When **contrasting** two verbs and objects like this, they have to show the same word order: and the objects must come in front of their respective verbs:

*A bíró **ügyvédeket keres** és **színészeket talál**.*
